# pet-adoption

Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day around the world. There are a limited number of shelters and foster homes available. If we are able to predict the speed at which a pet will be adopted, adop1on centres and foster homes can distribute resources more efficiently and implement targeted strategies accordingly.
PetFinder.my is Malaysiaâ€™s leading animal welfare platform since 2008. It has accumulated a database of over 150,000 animals. We will use this data to answer the following questions:

- What is the best predictive model to predict whether or not a pet will be adopted within 100 days?
- Which features play an important role in adoptability of a pet?
- What can adoption shelters do to increase the chance for pets in shelters to be adopted?


This project encapsulates data wrangling (pandas, scipy, numpy), data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), data exploration, feature engineering (NLP - tfidf), feature selection (weight of evidence, information value, variance inflation factor), classification models (Logistic Regression, Random forest and XGBoost), feature importance, SHAP analysis and data storytelling.
