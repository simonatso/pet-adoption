Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please.

0aaf6976a,1,3,0,0,"Three gorgeous medium length hair cats rescued from a roadside in setapak. Snowy is the mama cat. She has greyish black fur with a white undercoat. I don't know how else to describe it. She looks dark grey but if you brush her fur up its all white underneath.. She's no more than 2 years old, still a young lady. She's an affectionate and intelligent cat that prefers a quiet, mellow environment. I think her type of coat coloring is called Black Smoke. The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens. She loves sleeping and cuddling up with Snowy all day. The silver tabby is Rajah. I've named him after Princess Jasmine's pet tiger in Disney's Aladdin cartoon. He's more adventurous than his cozy, comfort-loving sister. Every time I check on them, he's awake and looking at me with wide eyes. The kittens will be ready for adoption in about 4-6 weeks time, once they are fully weaned and litter-trained. Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. Although I do volunteer with the Selangor SPCA in my free time, I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter.

Two months ago she was rescued from the streets, as she was malnourished, suffering from cat flu and heavily pregnant. The tablets prescribed by the vet to treat her caused a miscarriage but perhaps that was the universe saying she was too small to give birth. Since then she has been treated for cat flu and has been spayed. She has also had her vaccinations and been dewormed. We believe that she was someone's pet until she became pregnant as she has no fear of humans and is litter trained. She is very friendly, loving and adores cuddles and playing with her toys. She is not good with dogs. Adoption is free.

GERBERA is a tropical plant of the daisy family, native to Asia and Africa, with large brightly colored flowers. Just like this little kitten that we are fostering - Gerbera, she is as beautiful as the flower. Gerbera was rescued months ago at a food court, she was only a 2 months old baby during that time. Poor little baby was hiding under a car and meowing loudly seeking for help as there were a group of excited dogs wanted to hunt her and they kept running and waiting around the car. With help of some kind people there, we managed to shooed those doggie away and brought her home. Gerbera loves a lot to have companion and friends, she do not like much to be cuddled but she will always stay beside you and ask for a pat and ""massage"", she lovesss a lot when people sayang her. Gerbera is always happy when we're back home, she will always purr when we're at her side. But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends. She can eat together with friends if in different bowl but when they re eating same bowl of food, she will be very nervous and lift up her front paw to stop anyone from nearing the bowl but of course she do not bite or hurt anyone.. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Gerbera ♥",6,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10978558939306872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11139195252274804,0.0,0.1828406539736756,0.0,0.07829282640714617,0.0,0.088345821298377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The couple that moved in was left to look after them and has slowly been finding homes for the cats over the last year. There were 28 to begin with and there are 18 left. The last 18 NEED HOMES URGENTLY as the couple is no longer able to care for them. Due to some personal issues, and a new baby then need to move out. None of the local pet associations are willing to take them on so it is once again left up to concerned caring citizens to help out and lend a hand. THIS is an URGENT call for HELP! These cats need homes within the NEXT TWO WEEKS. Please invite ALL your friends to this event which shall be on going until all the cats are rehomed. Invite them ALL because even if they themselves do not want a cat, they may know someone who knows someone who does.

We are looking for someone to adopt him as we have too many cats. It would be great if the person can also adopt his siblings - Inky and Pinky, although this is not a must. We prefer to give him up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter him and also take him for regular vet checks.

Then I found it laying motionless at a nearby housing area last week, with eye infection, the flu & a bad case of kurap (scabies). Took it in to the vet immediately & currently she is being treated for scabies (kurap, almost healed already) and flu (still ada have a bit of selsema, but should clear up soon, as she's still on some medication). Overall, she's in much better shape now :) Kitten has been dewormed & de-flead & due to be discharged in 1-2 days' time. Her color is a dark tortoiseshell. She is very manja & needy in nature. Always seeking for attention & affection. Maybe because she lacks love..so a lot of love is needed for this baby! Serious adopters needed urgently! Adoption is free.

3e2cc2690,2,1,200,0,"This kitten which I named him Brave,was lying lifeless under the dark staircase of my condo. I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

I discovered them pretty much the day they were born and have been taking care of all of them indoors. All three kittens are male with distinct personalities developing. They have lovely markings on their coat. They haven't been weaned yet but will be ready for adoption by the 15th of July. I am slowly transitioning them to solid food and mummy cat and I are litter training them. Mummy cat is very affectionate and will love to sit by you and be scratched. She will make a really lovely companion for someone. She has settled in quite comfortably so I foresee she will adapt quite easily. She is quite a young mother, no more than 2 years old. She also seems friendly towards other cats (my two cats are not the friendly type hence she needs to be adopted). My request would be for potential adopters to neuter/spay the kittens (once of suitable age) and mummy cat so that we don't end up with more strays on our streets.

281618ba5,4,1,100,5,"Shiro is a white lilac-pointed kitty who looks a bit like Taylor Swift. She is timid but gentle and very intelligent. She thinks the best place in the world is to be near her human at all times. She will insist on joining you when you watch TV, use the computer, cook, use the toilet, shower and will even try to help you choose the clothes to wear. She looks like a Siamese cat, but she is a local street-born, complete with a double-kink tail. Also like a Siamese cat, she has a wide vocabulary of sounds from cute raspy squeaks to out-loud cries. Her purr motor is loud and turns on very easily. Shiro has a silky soft coat and greatly enjoys playing with her toys and getting her fur brushed. 11 March . Rescued from the streets and was covered with filth, car grease and was mostly skin and bones. 12 March . Shiro was taken to the vet where she was de-wormed and de-fleaed and given antibiotics. She weighed g on that day and pronounced to be a girl and 2 and half months old. 30 March . Shiro was given her first vaccination and was de-wormed again. Her weight has shot up to 1.25kg. The vet thought that she is closer to 3 and half months old at this point. 29 Apr . Done with the second jab and she weighed 1.75kg. 27 May . Done with the third and final vaccination jab. Her weight at this point is 2.15kg. 3 June . Spayed. The adopter shall receive her vaccination card and medical records from the vet. Current diet: * Dr. Gary's Best Breed kibbles. Taste of the Wild cat kibbles. * 2 meals per day of fresh raw chicken/beef pieces mixed with either one of these canned food – Fancy Feast, Monge and Fussie Cat. Or mixed with bonito/sardine flakes (the type sold in Japanese food section) * Favourite treat – washed and blanched ikan bilis mixed with raw chicken. * Also eats raw chicken neck chopped to small kitty bite sizes. Given no more than once a week as it can cause constipation. * She enjoys Farm Fresh plain yoghurt. * As treats, she likes Greenies Roasted Chicken Dental Cat and Greenies Smartbites Skin & Fur Salmon. Cat litter – Shiro currently uses Cat's Best by ÖkoPlus. She loves clean litter boxes and is obsessed with how the flushing toilet works. Suitable adopter – a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a ""safe room"" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter – a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an ""open door” policy – Shiro cannot survive outdoors. To be outdoors, a cat has to have some tough badass attitude, and Shiro has none of it. She is just a complete sweetheart who wants manja and sayang. Please email or text me why you want to adopt Shiro and introduce who you are.",26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08637029527001064,0.07033165075032882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09186717282569024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291393220365399,0.0,0.07286056712210076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Thank God it did not rain yesterday, otherwise it would have been drowned. After work, we set out to look for it again and this time, we found him. The moment he saw us, he ran....ran soooooo fast, escaping from us. And suddenly, he jumped up about 1 foot high into a hole in the drain. As usual, we put our hand inside the hole and managed to retrieve him. He was so hungry and we fed him wet food. Unfortunately we cannot keep him as we already have another 5 cats and 2 dogs at home.

74088eee1,12,1,0,0,"READ BEFORE DECIDING! Mio is an active, playful, and talkative male cat. He used to be my friend's pet, but later given to me because my friend moved oversea. He already stayed with me for about 5 months until now. He really is a smart and beautiful cat, but since I'm just a university student I cannot afford the fee for his vaccination and neuter. He is now in heat state and need to be neutered soon or mate with female cat, but I don't dare to mate him with stray cat. So that is why I choose to give him for adoption for free, as a hope that someone might adopt him to take him to the vet or just mate him with female cat that you might have. Plus I will also give along his cage, food bowl, and litter box, all for free. Here I tell you some about Mio personality so you can take into consideration before adopt him. - Very talkative, so you have to be ready to hear some noises from him - He is on heat, so he will be more more noisy during night sometimes - Spoiled cat, so make sure you give him lot of affection - Toilet trained, he really can pee in your toilet bowl if you allow him to - Super clean, he doesn't like dirty cat litter - Stubborn, he can become very stubborn when it comes to bed, which he might insist to sleep with you on your bed or jump to your lap and he will become noisy if you don't let him to do so. - Afraid of thunder and heavy rain, yes if there is a thunder storm or heavy rain he will definitely meowing very loud to get your attention, he will be quiet when he is accompanied. - Might become aggressive to new cat, I guess this is because he is on heat, so if you wished to mate him with your cat it may take longer time for them to adapt. - Do not confine the cat in the cage although I give you the cage, because it will make him stress. But overall, he is very nice, cute and unique isn't he? He also love to cuddle :) Contact me by email or whatsapp if you are ready to adopt him and accept the consequences above. I really hope that you will become a nice new owner, and please BE A COMMITTED AND RESPONSIBLE OWNER for Mio.

I have too many cats at home and after much consideration, I've decided to let both brothers go because they're the most affectionate among my many cats and they absolutely love being in the company of people. They're the sort of cats who would drop to the floor when they meet anyone and roll on their backs begging for tummy rubs. They're also very vocal and we've spent many nights and days having such great conversation. They're an absolute delight for companions! They're very attached to one another which is why they can ONLY be adopted together as I can't bear to have the brothers separated.

Kenzo is loving, funny and super friendly boy. He is a clingy & spoilt cat with adorable attitude. Active and playful but will collapse after 5-10mins of playing, maybe because he is kinda fat.

You will also be given probation to see if she fits your personality. I will reduce asking to maybe twice a year if I feel both of you are adapting well till I stop asking permanently. -** Adopters will need to pick up this kitten. ( Location : Bandar Utama ) - Proactive adopters will be given priority. **** Please provide details about yourself such as name, age, status : working/studying, local/international, hometown, experiences with pet (if none, research and explain), your house type, family members, your reasons to adopt, your knowledge to care for kittens. ** Please note that you will be asked other relevant questions to see if you are eager enough to have her in your life. - Vaccination is required to prevent any disease or infection. (I MAY ask for the deposit of first year vaccination and will return once you have vaccinated the kitten with proof. I may or may not. However you are required to inquire at your preferred clinic and inform me on the vaccination amount. (Please understand this is only to assure she will be in good hands, and caring owners will not hesitate) - Please spay/neuter when she is 6 months old (December /January ) as this will make her healthier and happier. - Please avoid outdoors as she may want to go out often, get into cat fights, catch diseases and etc. Be with her if you want to let her out. .................................................................................................... ""Please remember that animals are living souls. They need consistent care, attention and boundless love. They will grow up, make messes and trouble, you will need to be willing to spend some money on their food and medical just like they are your children. They will love you if you love them equally. If you are serious about adopting a family member and you are willing to spend time, money and effort to take care of the kitten then by all means contact me."" .................................................................................................... ......................ABOUT KITTEN......................... - She was rescued by one of the owners of Happie n Jovie ( Centrepoint BU ). She was found wandering around at Taman Tun Market calling for food. - Estimated to be around 2 months old. - Although she is a stray kitten, she is VERY human friendly. She isn't afraid to approach any human. I think maybe because she was surrounded by humans at the market. - She was really skinny, had flu and tiny eye infection, had lil fleas, dirty and has a skin issue. Her skin was dry and fur were shedding. She was really quiet the first 2 days, doesn't play but wants to be around human all the time so you can imagine how much she suffered on the streets. - She will be dewormed later on after the skin issue is cleared. (Improving well as she has been visiting the vet and is under medication) - She plays well, eats well, and her stool and urine looks good too! Familiar with litter sand. She has a playful biting habit nowadays though. She loves to bite my slipper and the boxes and my legs and my arms and the bottle and everything she can get her tiny paws on. I think it is cuz of her growing teeth. - She LOVES to play with paper clamp. - She likes to sleep with company. She's always beside me either on the bed or on the chair beside where I sleep. She also sleeps where I work or watches me do my work. - She has the sweetest meow just like the sweet kitten she is. She replies when you talk or look at her. - She is trained to come with a whistle tone. - I'm trying my best to get her in the best shape she can be before the adoption. - Please feel free to ask any further questions on the kitten.

I am safe now. My rescuer has put me on Avoderm and IAMS diet. She says I've got a good appetite. I have been Frontlined and dewormed too. I have just learned to use the litterbox, so give me a little bit more time and I'll be a pro at that (although my rescuer thinks I'm pretty good at it already)! My rescuer says that I'm very sweet. I've learned to warm up to humans and I love chin rubs and to be cuddled. I feel safe when I'm wrapped up in a blanket and held in someone's arms. I love to run after the cat teaser stick -- it's my favourite toy. I'm also quite good at playing the phone app for cats; it's cool...but nothing like giving the ol' feather stick a good chase! I promise I would make a wonderful kitty if I could grow up in a loving environment. The vet said I'm about 1.5 months old now and looking forward to a long and healthy life! Please contact my rescuer Aida at if you would like to adopt/foster me.

Cat's personality leads me to believe she used to be someone's pet and they abandoned there. I just separated her from the kitten whom I've found a home for. I feel awful, so with my little experience with cats I really hope I made the right decision. She's pregnant, can't fend for herself, overly friendly, so I desperately need someone to adopt her. Sorry, I can't keep the cats even if I wanted to. When I'm home, I live with my family who can't stand cats. In penang, I live in the college hostel that has a very very strict no pets policy. PLEASE!!!!! If anyone is willing to adopt her please call me!

But before that please do consider the responsibilities of being an owner and decide only after serious consideration. There is no point in wanting these kitties out of impulse and then deciding to abandon or give them away later. Animals have feelings too and the right thing to do is to treat them as a part of the family and not just as a pet. Together we can make this world a better place for all living things and help save lives. Interested parties please sent a message (via petfinder.my) / facebook private message / email and please share about yourself (eg Malaysian/expatriate?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Any juvenile-type e-mails without providing the necessary details (ie tell us about yourself, your place and cat ownership experience) required will be not be replied. Please don't just provide a phone number because we won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. My apologies if the above questions seem to be intrusive or offensive in any way but we are looking for a truly loving and responsible adopter for the felines. All this resulted from our experience in rescuing and rehoming cats. Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either. It is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into a wonderful two way relationship. The important thing is to look at them as a part of our loved ones and not just another animal. Where there is love, relationship and trust will grow.

I have been keeping him for 2 years, but was recently given a warning notice by the condo management that MBPJ has started taken action in removing pets in apartments after a year of my stay. We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Molly (3yr, female, neutered mother of Zee) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Zee, he is 2yr, male, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property. For confirmed adopter, I can still arrange for meet up even if its out of Klang Valley.

They were found skinny and a little raggedy in a fishy styrofoam box by Brickfields Monorail station, but after a good cleaning, some healthy feeding, and a trip to the vet to thoroughly remove any extra ""guests"" they had, they're proving to be two lively, curious bundles of joy. (See the videos section to see what I mean!) Suit (Soot) is an adventurous girl who loves to climb and loves to eat even more, while Tie is a little more polite gentleman who loves it when he's being gently cleaned or combed. They are approximately just under 4 weeks old and currently being weaned on soft kitten food.

Not sure who had took all of us away from our mother, and dump us at the backlane of a shop. We were very hungry and we were almost eaten alive by surrounding stray dogs. In the midst of dying of hunger, luckily an angel came. He is the shop owner there, and he decided we should live, found all of us a temporarily foster home to take care of us. My fosterer took care of all of us when we were 4 weeks old, from sick, tiny and boney kittens. We are now healthy, playful and active 12 weeks old kittens. We thanked our rescuer and fosterer, for they have given us a chance to live. Please adopt us, we need a permanent home, as my fosterer said we are now healthy, big enough to be cared for easily and ready to be loved. Please give us a permanent loving home, and we promised to return your love. Thank you very much for adopting me. Please call/whatsapp/sms or to adopt me. Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.08894866978756681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09644434388955066,0.0,0.0,0.17566269701751133,0.0,0.16863400946467336,0.0,0.0,0.35417218425225866,0.07846350669831939,0.0,0.1278032319152547,0.11327614117296013,0.0,0.0

Im begging any kind hearted to adopt them. I really really dont have enough space to keep them as Im staying in small apartment and I already have few kittens to take care.

The color is rather unique, where there are white, orange and cream colors. Oh yes, he likes to ""meow"" a lot. Small Black, the third born kitten. Look elegant and magnificent, probably because of its color. He is black and his hair is rather soft. His chest are white and also white-legged like wearing a socks. His eyes are always round as in ready for ""attacking"" mode. Orengy, second born kitten. A little careless and playful. His eyes were squinting. Long tail, orange tabby and white. The face looks confused, but also love to play. Lastly, Teleng. The first born kitten, getting severe flu when he was two months old, caused him a fever reaching 42 degrees celsius and even seizures. Now he's fully healed, but his head slightly tilted due to the fever. That's why he looks pretty cute with his shortcomings. Just like his brother, Teleng is black and white-legged.

After a couple of days, took her back home and got her to the vet. Got her examined, especially her eye. The vet advised it could be self trauma or an accident that might have gotten her left eye, otherwise there is no sign of contagious bacteria or virus. She has been vaccinated, dewormed for the 1st round and given immune tabs to boost her immune as well. For the left eye, she was given a special kind of oilment to aid healing and also a maintenance to avoid any infection. She has been with me for about a month now. The eye doesn't bother her at all. She is a brave little survivor. She is healthier and more active than ever. I have another adult cat at home, and they just love to play and play.

b631b7e4a,8,1,0,0,"(Urgent) This boy lives in the garage of my condo. I regularly catch the strays living around to neuter and vaccinate them. I did so with that boy last week. He is neutered and got his first vaccine shot. I am keeping him at home the time for him to heal properly. He is born in that garage, from a mix-siamese mum. His siblings disappeared but he stayed along with his mum. He has a really gentle nature so the other cats are bullying him. It turns out that he is really shy but loves being pet. With dome time, he will definitely get used to a family home. He already learnt how to use the litter. I can’t keep him as I already adopted 3 strays from downstairs that I will bring with me when I will leave Malaysia. So I am trying to see if I can find him a good family. I will keep him until the 10th of April. If by then I haven’t found a family, I will release him where I caught him. I will only let him go to a family that is not caging cats. Knowing where he comes from, caging will only make him unhappy. No outdoors, at least at the beginning, would be recommended. I am not going to ask you to pay for the neutering and vaccine, as I am willing to do it for giving strays a better life. All I will ask you is to keep the vaccination process on every year and to provide him a healthy and happy life. A cat lives an average of 15years. Please consider that if you adopt him. I am not getting him out of the streets to have him get back there in a few years.",4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1174188491806396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17085594913255414,0.0,0.0,0.0

3d136a793,3,1,0,0,"Hello, Max-A-Million here! ♥ My rescue story is a rough one. I strayed too far from my mom-cat and like all lost kittens, I meowed / called out for days. Foster mummy heard my meowing from afar. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but she was trying (in vain) to look for me. ♥ Then came one stormy and rainy evening. I somehow found my way to foster mummy's backyard. I called out again, and this time foster mummy came outside, determined to rescue me. Boy did I protest hard when she laid her hands on me...hissing, screaming, biting at her gloves! She eventually wrapped a towel around me and everything went dark. ♥ I was brought to a quiet room, where the scent of kibbles greeted me. There were several bowls of food and fresh water laid out. I didn't stop to think about anything else, I went straight for my first proper meal in days! ♥ I didn't let foster mummy have it easy. The very sight of her walking into the room each day would send me running to a corner (I even urinated a few times out of fear). Still, she remained patient and kept talking to me in a calm voice. She began bringing me treats during each visit and this is when I really started to open up. ♥ Fast forward a week ahead, here I am! Any person who sees / handles me today would find it hard to believe that I was once a wild / feral kitten. I purr at the very SIGHT of people and I LOVE being petted, carried, belly-rubbed, you name it! I'm gentle when I play too (no claws) and my favorites are string-toys and anything bushy / crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, etc). ♥ Foster mummy has already taken me to the vet for my first full check-up. I was de-wormed and given a clean bill of health. Now I'm ready for that special / permanent family to share my life with! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Max-A-Million would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age. ◘ Max-A-Million would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

0d653b602,2,1,0,0,"I just found and caught a stray kitten at the back of my kitchen. It was raining heavily and the little kitten was all wet and hungry. I waited for hours to see any sign of the mother cat but there is none. So I believe that the little kitten is abandoned by the mother cat. Anyway, I managed to catch the little kitten and currently he/she is in the cage. I am still unable to hold the little kitten as he/she is still afraid of human contact. So, I am unable to know the little kitten's gender yet. My hunch is that the little kitten is a female :) I am looking for any potential adopter who is willing and kind enough to adopt this little kitten. The potential adopter has to be very patience with this little kitten as he/she is afraid of human. I believe that with tender loving care and patience, the little kitten will turn out to be a wonderful companion for the potential adopter. So, if any of the genuine adopter who is willing and able to care for this little kitten, please give me a call . Thank you. 1/3/16 Its been a week since I rescued this kitten and I found out that she's really a female and so I named her ABBIE. She's still wary of strangers but she's comfortable with me to the extend that she allows me to carry her on my lap and clip her nails. I hope that as time progresses, she will be more open to her surroundings and other people. 4/3/16 I think the kitten is male now that I have seen a little 'hump' near his rear end. So I am changing his name from Abbie to Aggie. 😊 9/3/16 Aggie is doing very well and quite playful. Hope he will get a new family soon.",12,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6797854730131118,0.0,0.0,0.04689987128697423,0.05972036267631019,0.0,0.06770837379628282,0.0,0.0

For adoption costs, please refer to: FEMALE KITTEN – RM (This adoption fee includes a deposit of RM for spaying. This deposit will be refunded once the queen is spayed before it comes on heat, failing which the deposit will be forfeited.) Rescuer Note: Kittens are not ready to be neutered yet until they are 6 months old. It is very important to neuter them when they are ready, as this will prevent them from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cats are more aggressive.",8,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4716135743766501,0.0,0.0,0.19810050213505048,0.0,0.11176855124459067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

a0124e47a,6,1,100,0,"Mr Stripey (his temporary foster name) was rescued as part of a 3-kitten all-male litter together with their mother from a backlane opposite my home in early October . and after ensuring that they are in good health and well-socialised after almost 2 months of fostering them, the kittens are now ready to be rehomed. - They are applied with Revolution monthly to protect against fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms (dewormed). - Mr Stripey's weight has bloomed from 1.7kg on 11 October to 2.3kg as at 15 November . - They are fed with Evo premium dry kitten kibbles. - I'm feeding them with vet-approved Vetri-DMG liquid supplement to boost their growing development. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Catit premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - I regularly clean their eyes and noses with saline solution and their ears with Ilium Oticlean. I also trim their nails. Their fur is short but silky clean since they are not allowed outdoors. - Mr Stripey has been vaccinated on 18 October (4-in-1, RM50) with a booster vaccination on 15 November (4-in-1, RM50) at a total cost of RM. - Mr Stripey's behaviour is outgoing and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for his future when you return to your home country. 2) He must be kept indoors at all times. 3) You should have a cat cage to confine him for the first few weeks to let him feel secure and get used to your home surroundings. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 8 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover his vaccination cost. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If Mr Stripey is adopted with his sibling, Mr Fiesty ( ), there would be a 50% reduction on the second adoption fee. 8) It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Mr Stripey. 9) Please adopt on a weekend as I'm working full-time on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Mr Stripey, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.

[names are all temporary, for convenience] Curly [Male Ginger] Has a curly tail, cute white toe socks and a playful and curious personality. Sort of the 'Big Brother' of the litter, a little bigger than the rest and a outgoing personality to match! Chinaman [Male Ginger] Has unique eyes, and a comparably calmer demeanor compared to Curly, Tiger and Tortoiseshell, but still plays very well with all siblings at playtime 3. Trinity [Female tricolour of white, orange, black] Very playful and energetic, she is the one to initiate play all the time and runs around the most compared to her sibs. Also very fastidious in her cleaning, as I see her clean herself longer than the others do. She has a soft, very prettily coloured coat and white stockings Big Eyes [Female gray tabby] She has a comparatively gentler temperament, and is more on the reserved side like Chinaman, and both like to sit and stare quietly at times, but when it's playtime she runs about with the rest. She has softer fur than the others, and may turn out to have medium rather than short length fur. Tiger [Female gray-brown tabby] The runt of the litter, she is lively, energetic and can be very vocal to compensate for her small size. She keeps up just fine with everyone, and has a rather unique shade of coating, a gray orange hue.

1077fb67a,2,1,65,0,"20 September update: Roma has been adopted by Li of Kajang! Thank you! : D Roma was rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.

9193c38af,2,1,0,0,"Indoor cats: I would prefer my cats are kept as indoor cats with space to run around and play. I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation. Good quality food, vet visits, etc will need to be budgeted.",2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.11055262802704817,0.0,0.10148971657649576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2158976834249766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07939699412531752

Blue kitten!' That's my fav color! its hard to find a blue kitten/cat nowadays unless they are British Short hair or Russian blue. the reason i want to let her go even i really2 want to keep her are: 1. am a student 2. am a wife 3. am a missy to my mom, shes a strokee 4. we got 6 cats already nothing much i know bout this BlueCHEESE ;). 24 hours with her just tell me she: 1. never meows 2. not scared when being bath 3. so manja, likes to purrr, likes to be hugg 4. most of her body covered with muscle, NO fat. so she is quite heavy 5. the coat is so pretty especially under the lights as the coat starts to look like Velvet. it shines and is really2 soft when touch 6. she has 2 big round cooper eyes 7. she got a wrinkle tail just like wrinkle fries ;) 8. she is SOLID BLUE but there is a small white patch under the tummy~ very low white The person that adopt her must SPAY her. its a must! i will ask from time to time as i do not want her to get into a wrong home. Adoption fee will be charged of RM10. whom ever is willing to pay for her then the person is willing to take care of her.

But no one has come to claim him :( He is really loving, sweet and playful, and just wants someone to manja and sayang him. He is quite fluffy and gebu, so we think he might be a medium hair cat when he grows up. The pictures don't do him justice, but he has a really sweet face and personality. To be honest, we have fallen a little in love with him, but we already have 2 cats and have allergies, so we can't keep him. Please, if you are looking for a loving, playful and smart kitten to be part of your family, contact us and come and see him. Otherwise we'll have to take him to Paws :( ----- Story: We found an orange tabby kitten in Damansara Utama. He was hiding from another mother cat who was being very aggressive because she was near her kittens. We think he might be looking for his mother and just went near this cat, hoping for someone to take care or sayang him. He was shivering, limping slightly and had an ear pierced with a metal wire that was already turning rusty. So kesian.. We took him to the vet, who removed the piercing because it was hurting him. Good news, only minor injuries which are now healing nicely. We also dewormed and de-flea him. He was wearing a pink tag with the name ""NUR MAISARAH"" written on it. We are looking for his owner, or someone to adopt him.

Being a cat and all animal lover I thought poor thing, it must have been frightened or felt uncomfortable where she “lived” so decided to come have her kittens in my place. I also assumed she belonged to one of my many neighbours who apparently are “cat lovers or owners”….. the ones who let their cats run about and poo all over the condo area stinking up the area. Anyway I have provided mother and kittens with a safe and clean place to stay. The mother comes and goes, presumably to her owner or to look for food and do her business. Assuming she “belongs” to one of my neighbours I have put up signs on all blocks with pictures attached for the owner to come collect their bundle of fun, also saying “if you don’t I will have offer them up for adoption and/or send them all to SPCA. To date I have not had any replies to my posters. Lately the mother cat does not come back as often as she should and I’m doing my best to “feed” them. I never planned to keep them but just give them temporary shelter till someone claims them or the mother sorts herself out and returns to her own accommodation/owner or starts paying rent :-) Now I offer them to any cat lover/owners.

After a few rounds of medication and gastro-intestinal kibbles, he's much better now. His coat is smooth and shinny. He has good appetite and his poop is normal now. He's been de-flea, dewormed, vaccinated (1st dose only), and castrated. He's tested negative for FIV and FeLV. Gus has short-medium coat. He has a particularly long and fluffy tail.

63d254530,4,1,0,0,"Tabatha was rescued along with 7 other kittens after someone rounded them up and threw them away in a box by the roadside. They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy. Interested parties may text or email me.

10eea956d,4,1,0,6,"We were walking in the Georgetown city centre on a Friday night () and came across a poor little ginger kitten. It was malnourished and had a virus so bad that I initially thought it was abused. We offered it food and water but it was too weak to accept it. We knew that it would most likely die of hunger with the state it was in, so we brought it to the veterinary clinic. Since then we have nursed it back to health and brought it back to KL with us. What I have noticed that it is like no other streetcat I've seen before - friendly, cuddly, curious, supercool, overall a lovely character. You may have heard it all before but he is quite a special one! He is now fully recovered from his wounds. We have also dewormed and defleaed him, and his fur is purrfectly beautiful. We are now progressing him with the best vaccination possible. We need to leave the country within the next 2 weeks, so we urgently need to find him wonderful owners who will love him and take care of him. Ginger's hobbies are: football, hunting, extended naps with humans, cuddle big time, getting bellyrubs, and eating!",7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2722166351264154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2232411771781281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2266794206060417,0.2686326371039369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As a result, I decided to spay her and rehome her since she's still young. - She has no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - She was dewormed by a vet on 20 June . - She has been applied with Revolution on 5 August to protect her against ticks, fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms for a month. - Her weight is 4.15 kg as at 7 August , a gain of 0.65kg since 10 July . - I'm feeding her with premium dry cat kibbles. - She can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the cat to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage her health and shorten her life. - She's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using pine litter which is good for her (& human's) health and the environment. - Her poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as her overall health. - She has been spayed on 28 June at a cost of RM. - She has been vaccinated on 10 July at a cost of RM50. - Booster vaccination and deworming on 7 August at a cost of RM68. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate her yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM50 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only partially cover the RM spaying, vaccination & deworming costs which I'm subsidising. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt California, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.",13,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397572161215892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1093342581069575

He was picked up at a local mamak restaurant, where he had been dumped by a family. When I took him in, Swagger was skinny, dull and just wanted to sleep all the time, but with lots of food and lots of love he has blossomed into a playful affectionate kitten! Swagger loves his tin-foil ball, his mouse toy and a little bit of gentle wrestling. He also really loves his food and bowl of milk. A curious and adventurous animal, he loves exploring the world around him, but in the evening when he's exhausted he also likes to sleep on laps. When he gets excited, his beautiful long tail fluffs up like a mini Christmas tree. He likes to be scratched under the chin, and especially loves to have someone rub his white furry tummy. A great purrer, Swagger is also an accomplished kisser of noses. Swagger is toilet trained, clean, a good eater and a pleasant, well-mannered kitten, suitable for children and adults.

The doctor confirmed it was a male kitten, between the ages of two months, and after examination, the doctor confirmed it was in healthy condition. Cat flea medication was given. In good faith, our family is unable to care for this kitten because it was too small, moreover, my wife and I work on long day, while the children are in college. This kitten needs someone who can give greater attention to him. And we already have a big male cat and a rabbit. We fear we can not provide love and care to this kitten. By the way I name him ""TWENITU"", because I met him on the / :-) So, I appeal to anyone who is willing to take care of TWENITU to contact me.

2e41f018c,2,1,0,0,"He is called Jellybean because he has always been small in size but strong in character and very, very sweet. He enjoys climbing up onto your shoulder to sniffle your hair and nibble your ear. He grew up with 4 bigger brothers and could not compete with them for milk and space while baby. So he was always the smallest and sickly one. His right eye still looks wonky due to his sickly babyhood. The vet says that he might out grow it as he matures. But if not, it can be corrected (but not necessary). But he is healthy and active now in spite of his wonky right eye. In fact, to make up for his small size, he has grown a big ""I-can-do-it"" attitude and is often the leader of his bigger brothers showing them new places to explore and new games to play. And because of his sickly babyhood, he had developed a very positive outlook in life - whatever happens he will still go, ""Yay! Happy, happy."" He is a well-socialized intelligent kitty because he got the double privilege of growing up with brothers and a mother cat and got regular daily hand-feeding by various kind people since babyhood. So he gets along cheerfully with cats and humans. He loves to play with the kids in the neighbourhood. Born on 15 Nov , he is brother to Caramel and Muffin: And brother to Cupcake and Cookie: It would be ideal if he could be adopted together with Cupcake and Cookie because they are now very close to each other. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-worm treatment was done on 6 December and 6 Jan . * Vaccinated on 20 Jan - 1st jab. * Vaccinated on 24 Feb - 2nd jab * Next vaccination jab is on 24 March . * On 6 Jan - he weighs over g. On 20 Jan , he weighs g. On 24 Feb , he weighs 1.6kg. * Frontline anti-flea spray treatment was applied on 23 Feb . * Able to eat solid food - kibble, wet cat food and chicken. * Litter-box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets regular good fresh food. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure that he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

b6fbfa344,12,1,0,0,"Profile Ringkas: Name: Mama Kin Age: Adult cat.Probably 1 year and half. Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)",12,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.1433932159560933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04136260125470655,0.0,0.0,0.03766869988966184,0.0,0.14464593796102174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03365106350171576,0.0,0.0,0.09716268824172362,0.0,0.0

My foster mummy Lyn found me all alone in the driveway of a vacant house on jalan sri hartamas 2 on saturday september 12 after receiving a phonecall about an abandoned kitten. I was curled up in a tight ball and didn't move when she touched me and spoke to me. I was covered in filth and looked dead. The lady that called her about me told her that my siblings and cat mummy used to all live in that empty house together but then my mummy moved away and took my siblings with her.. i think she forgot about me. the people in the house next door watched and waited for her to come back but she didnt.. that's when they called for help because they knew i was dying. I have been with my foster mummy for almost 2 weeks now and i'm feeling much better though i haven't grown much. I'm still too thin and i don't like the kitten milk formula very much. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 to 4 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Pinky. - See if potential adopter and Pinky are suitable for each other. I will ask some questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Pinky vaccinated before being able to take Pinky home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I might occasionally ask adopter for updates to see how Pinky is doing. Interested parties can sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.

Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to their adoption: *De-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population. As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered. They will be ready for adoption after they settle down, but I will screen potential adopters now. kittens can be adopted individually or together, I can deliver them to their new home within KL / Klang Valley Area. Please help to share around with your friend, any other rescue community platform will be fine, help them to find a forever home ! Serious adopters only. Kindly contact me ASAP via email, SMS or whatsapp for who are interested. I will contact you as soon as I can.

We were too late to neutered Miao Miao and found she is pregnant again. 12 cats in the house are just too much for us to handle. We love the kittens very much, but we have to find future good owner for them for their better future, as we can't provide them enough attention to each of them. This batch of kittens is mixed bengal. as their father is mixed bengal and their mother is DSH calico. All kittens are healthy, active , and fun loving. Their will definitely cheer you up, when u see them playing around. All kittens are litter-trained, and feed on ""orijen"" kibble.

47a142b50,2,1,0,4,"Hello. Meet Tookins, who reinvents herself from a traumatised stray to a techno savvy kitten. She is about 3-4 weeks old. She is an adorable Calico with a stumpy tail that wiggles when she is super happy. I found her in the middle of a busy road, too scared to move. Luckily she was not hurt. Just shocked. Even from that first encounter, I knew that she is one lovable kitty. Her hobbies include playing with anything that moves, glows or just plain old bits of paper. She loves cuddling to her Mrs Bunny, her bff. Tookins is a natural-born cuddler and a lap kitty. Also a shoulder kitty. Out of all her long list of repetoires, she is also a Youtube and Netflix bingewatcher. She loves teenage movies with good villains in it. Tookins has been checked by the vet and she has been given a clean bill of health. She has been dewormed and deloused (Advocate). She cannot be vaccinated yet as she is so tiny according to the vet. Tookins eats boiled tuna, Whiskas Kitten pouch food and Royal Canin Kitten. She is fully toilet trained and at the moment stays indoors at all times for health and safety reasons. As you can see, she is well loved by my family. As a kitten rescuer and fosterer though, I am willing to share my love for her with a responsible forever family who will care for her unconditionally. If I found her a good home, I can rescue more kittens in need. There is no adoption fee. All I am asking is for Tookins' future mom or dad to: 1. NEUTER her as soon as she can be safely neutered. 2. Make sure her VACCINATIONS are up-to-date 3. Provide her with everything she needs to stay safe, comfortable and happy for the rest of her life. So if you are looking for a quirky, fun-loving, cuddly and not to mention super adorable wee fluff, look no further, for Tookins is your kind of kitten. Please do not hesitate to send me a message. I will then give you a questionaire to be filled in. Thank you.

Friendly first Time adopters with experience are welcome. 2. Keep in contact.Please send me picture of her every now and then.I want to be assured that she's fine and growing well. 3. Be absolutely sure that you will commit to her before adopting. 4. I will try to converse with you a bit before giving her because I want to know the adopter's background. About the kitty : This is a female kitten. She was wandering outside at the opposite neighbor's house. and I accidentally called out to her and didn't expect her to come in running. Just came in and made herself home. She is a veryyyyy friendly kitten. She is the first kitten I didn't had to try to tame. WE found who the mother cat is. The mom came in and checked on her for 3 days and bit farewell. The mom trusts us. Compared to the other kittens we have had, she is the most gentle one. She plays but not naughty. This little kitty is a bit greedy in eating but good thing is that she's not violent. She's quite intelligent. When it comes to food. Knows every sign food is coming. Doesn't scratch or bite...or haven't learned to yet (only happens when we let). Gets friendly with the big cats very fast. So if you have other cats, won't be a problem. I'd love to keep her but everyday before I go to bed I have to shut her outside the house. She spends the whole day inside and at night I feel bad shutting her outside and seeing her desperately trying to come back inside...I'm not given other choices. So that's why she's up for adoption. I'm not allowed to keep her. I don't want her to become a stray cat. She pees and poops on grass.Sometimes she goes on her own and other times she scratches and jumps on our legs to ask us to bring her to the toilet grass). When she wants to pee, her tail fur stands up and it looks like brush while meowing a lot. aaaaand you gotta love that face of hers.",8,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3191883749105221,0.0,0.0,0.08810560017131808,0.10803478223788003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11836595043688787,0.0,0.0

I used to weigh 7Kgs. But with the diet plan and meanest owner ever. I got to a healthy 5.6Kgs+- I love people. I nibble when people tickles me too much. I play with my cat tree (Please get me one) I'm neutered, vaccined and dewormed About Salt. I'm a tiny version of bacon. I wear socks. I'm scared of people too. But I will follow whatever Bacon does. I wear socks and naturally I'm an angel. I'm tiny. I might be 6 months old. More or less. I was cold one night. I don't know where mommy went. I saw a red monster. But its warm. So I snuggled in. When the monster roar I cried. Then my parents saw me and pulled me out. And thats how I ended up with them. I'm not spayed but I'm vaccined and dewormed.

Prefers wet food over dry (although not a picky eater). ***PLEASE READ (Note for adopters)***: ○ Demetri must be kept % indoors for his own safety.

9a591a8d9,30,1,0,0,"This is Jasper.I have had him for almost 3 years now. The reason I am giving him up for adoption is because the place I live in is very unsuitable for him. There are too many stray cats in my area and Jasper has come home too many times after being involved in serious cat fights. I have had to take him to the vet hospital so many times as an emergency case because of his fighting. I tried to keep him indoors and not letting him go out, but he got very depressed and wasn't interested in anything anymore. He loves to go out and sit in the sun and to roll in the grass. However, where I live, the place is very dangerous and there are hardly any fields for him to run and play at. I am looking for someone who seriously loves and understands cats. It is very important that the area you live in should have a field/park as close to the house as possible, or hopefully, your housing area is safe and clean. He needs to go out into the field and play, otherwise he gets very cranky if you only lock him indoors. Jasper is a very loving cat, very chubby and fat. He's almost 6 kg. He loves people and loves to be petted. Also, he's a vegetarian. He only eats cat biscuits, nothing else. Not chicken, fish, prawn, etc. He's also trained to use the cat litter. But he has a weak immune system, and he's prone to getting a flu often. So if you are interested in Jasper, you also need to know that he needs a booster every week. It's a small bottle (about RM49) and it can last a few months. You only need to put 7ml of it in his mouth once a week, so that Jasper doesn't get the flu. I am only looking for serious adopters who will take very good care of Jasper and will love him very, very much. He's a very special and a beautiful cat.

a878a916e,2,1,0,0,"We found this amazing little guy abandoned in the streets of Mont Kiara at about 4 weeks old, alone and injured. We brought him home to nurse him back to health and found that he was the sweetest, most loving, kind and playful kitten ever (and i've had quite a few kittens in my life). Now at 6 weeks he is fully recovered and in NEED of a home as we will shortly be leaving the country. I can't stress enough how sad i am to part with this amazing cat and what a perfect pet he will be. If it was up to me I would most certainly keep him. We were looking at shelters to drop him to but i would feel much better placing him directly with a new owner. The most important thing to us is to find him an equally loving family to take him in. He is a tiny little guy. Pale golden cream tabby with white paws and belly. Right now his eyes are blue but they will probably develop as he matures. He is fully potty trained and is on a diet of baby cat food mixed with warm water (to soften it). Personality wise, he is very adaptable. We pulled him off the streets scared and untrained and within a day he figured out the cat box. Within two days he was coming over to sit on our laps and cuddle! As with most kittens his age he is playful but tends to entertain himself. He LOVES pets and will spend hours with you purring away with any attention you give him. Please contact me if you are at all interested. Time is of the essence! we will be leaving in less than two weeks!

The 2nd one is Duzell, the only female of the bunch. She's very playful and loves to follow you around once she gets close to you. Her colour is not too black and has a hint of gray. She has a pair of 'white stockings' on her back legs which makes her look even cuter. They are able to eat wet and dried food. But for now, mostly wet food and slowly introduce them to dried ones. Duzell can already use the litter box like her brothers, so she is toilet trained and won't make too much mess. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.",4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18796474519977988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1338138956430811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12452419924604376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470477628060494

Tortoiseshell cats are known for abundance of character and this lady is no different (Read here:). ♥ Sometimes she purrs - sometimes she has a lot to say (yes she talks  meows back). Sometimes she forces herself onto our laps for strokes - and at other times she plants a loving nip or two. ♥ She gets along great with cats her age and kittens. Is weary of bigger adult cats and only approaches if they're friendly (not growling or hissing). Otherwise she takes some time to adjust. ♥ Tequila is great with people although we would recommend that only adults or people adjusted to tortie behavior adopt her (as her nippings might not be tolerable for children). ♥ This girl is very clever with her little-box and eats her kibble without complaint. She has been vaccinated, dewormed and given spot-on prevention against fleas and other parasites. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Tequila must be kept INDOORS at all times (for her own safety). ○ Tequila must be SPAYED at the right age. ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc).

In total we have 15 cats and as such we are looking for individuals who are truly animal lovers and he or she has to be patient with the cat(s) adopted from us. All our cats are neutered or spayed. As long as you promise to give them ever lasting love, there won't be any fees incurred. Ah Onn and Ah Lok are one pair and they are inseparable. ""Onn Lok"" in Chinese means contentment. So we are looking for a kind soul who will take them as one pair and not break up their company. Ah Onn is male and is one year old. His hair is longer than the normal tabby because he is long hair mixed. He is always on the look out for Ah Lok, afraid that someone will bully her. Ah Lok is also one year old and she is very shy and reserved. Please be in touch with us if you are really keen and you must be an animal lover.

This would probably be my last batch of kittens since I would finally want to spay my cat after this. I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. This one is called Pepa or Pepper, another spice name. She's pretty chill kitten, doesn't run around much, but is pretty friendly and likes to play with her 'twin', Orey. The difference between her and Orey is she has brownish color on her legs. Orey can already eat wet food and a bit of dried food, so food wise, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. If you can, maybe get one pack of kitten milk and feed her that until it finishes. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.",2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1648575503933125,0.0,0.0,0.14172809616856644,0.0,0.0,0.11736366317448417,0.0,0.0,0.12324603165846322,0.0,0.0,0.17789359940771174,0.0,0.0,0.0

She loves to play a lot, no matter with her cat friends or with us, she can play with a plastic bag or anything that she found interesting for many many hours. Ranny is considered the naughtiest kitten that we ever taken care of, she runs like a thunder and loves to ""disturb"" us a lot :p But she's very smart, she knows things that she can't do, but she will purposely do that and run away fast. But we just can't angry her for long, she will always show the innocent face or make some cute pose to melt our heart. She's a very sweet girl indeed :) Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Ranny ♥",6,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.14168097830123516,0.0,0.15783855698023594,0.0,0.12260608924438512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16014802254649582,0.0,0.13143485014778095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12701463849726338,0.0,0.0,0.16086741212974084,0.0

3029fcad6,18,1,0,1,"This handsome fluffy guy walked into a food stall and was very friendly and very hunger. We decided to bring him to our office and get him used to people, which wasn't a problem at all. And to litter train him,which was every easy to do as long as the litter box is cleaned at least twice a day. He really doesn't like a dirty litter box He enjoys exploring and doing his ""rounds"" around the office and play outdoors (done under strict supervision), once he is done with that he just likes to chill out and look good and handsome. He is very mellow and will follow you everywhere just like your shadow. He loves being around people and being given lots loving attention. He also loves to chat and is fairly vocal which, we believe, is due to Morrison having either Siamese or Burmese blood in him. If you want a quiet or silent cat Morrison isn't right for you. The adopter should have a home with an enclosed yard which is cat proofed as Morrison does enjoy a little romp around the yard and, if given the chance the neighbourhood. Safety is very important so that Morrison can give his love to his guardian. Morrison may be an ""older"" cat but trust me he has a wonderful personality and will make a great and loving companion to anyones home. Do watch the video to see Morrison enjoying the yard and basking in being petted and given the love and attention he deserves.

66ad04874,0,1,0,0,"Hey everyone! So my friends and I were walking around some shop lots earlier this evening and we heard loud meowing coming from a box. To our not-so-surprise, we found a little kitty that some irresponsible nitwit had abandoned infront of phone store. The kitty is being fostered and taken good care of by a friend of mine right now, we are actually really concerned for the little one as she is only 1 week old. And yes, it's a SHE. As for now, she's weak on her limbs since she is only a week old and is without the presence of her mother. She has pretty blue eyes, in fact, that is one of the main features we noticed when we picked her up. ADOPTION IS ONLY FOR RESIDENTS IN THE PETALING JAYA/ KUALA LUMPUR AREA. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE KITTEN TO ANY ADOPTERS, ADOPTION IS BY MEANS OF COLLECTION ONLY. CONDITIONS UPON ADOPTION: 1) The kitten will need to be fully taken care of because of it's dyer need of care at only 2 weeks old. 2) The kitten is to be kept INDOORS at ALL TIMES. (We do not want another case of a homeless kitten.) 3) If you were to adopt this kitten, do expect calls from us from time to time to keep up on her condition as she is still a precious fragile baby that we have been fostering. 4) If Karma cannot adapt to her surroundings, Karma needs to be re-homed as it is only in a kittens nature to find comfort in where they wish to in the absence of the parent cat, and we wished to respect that. 5) Once Karma reaches the age of 1 year, Karma will need to be neutered and vaccinated to avoid further irresponsible abandoning of kittens. 6) We will not allow Karma to be caged, kittens (at least) need to be placed in a comfy kitten litter or a box layered with towels as they are in need of warmth, without warmth, fatality is at hand. 7) Karma is still weak on her limbs, she will require kitten milk, preferably without lactose. 8) Allow Karma to walk for bout 15 minutes a day under supervision to strengthen her limbs. We understand that there might be many terms and conditions, but we want the best for her.",4,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2101749575984235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2244383366649868,0.18347034150145716,0.0,0.23568738055544566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

She was walking along enjoying the weather when she came across the heartwarming sight of two little kittens snoozing on some porch steps.. Their mother stood watch nearby. At first she eyed Eileen suspiciously but then decided that she liked her. As a gesture of her desire for friendship, she immediately meowed at Eileen and demanded to be fed and petted. She also allowed Eileen to handle her kittens. That was the start of a beautiful friendship and suddenly Eileen had three kittycats on her hands.. Sweet Pea is the mama cat. She has a unique beautiful tortoiseshell coat and large, round, green eyes. She is very affectionate and sweet, a loving mother and would be a great companion for any cat lover. She's about 3 years old and received her first vaccination on December 6, . Dora is the adventurous rascal of the family. She's a marmalade tabby with bright blue eyes. She loves exploring and isn't scared of new people and places. She's always the first one to check things out. Sidney is a little shyer than his extraverted sister. He has green eyes and sleek black fur. He loves wrestling and tumbling around with his sister.. He's also mummy's boy and sticks to Sweet Pea. Once he gets to know you, he is a playful and manja little furball. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY.

b03114991,7,1,0,1,"“Fluffy” is a domestic long-haired feline. He was seen wandering around the block opposite mine. He could have been abandoned as he was found without a collar. According to one of the residents, she and her neighbour have been feeding him for the past one week. My husband bumped into him a couple of nights ago when “Fluffy” approached him. We have been feeding him dinner as other times, he went gallivanting and probably found his own meals. “Fluffy” is obviously domesticated which makes him sociable & approachable. He is sweet, affectionate and playful. We would love to keep him (it’s hard not to when he gives us that cute look!) but we already have 3 cats of our own. We think “Fluffy” may be less than a year old, may have been neutered and toilet-trained. We would love to see “Fluffy” find a new loving home where he truly belongs and make sure he'll be in good health. It would be a great waste to let him wander into danger and death. Notes: 1. We appreciate SERIOUS and COMMITTED adopters. If you're below 21yo, please get your parents' consent before writing to me. 2.

It was raining and the roads were noisy and congested with rush hour traffic but little nicholas saw fit to huddle in an overflowing gutter with water gushing all over him and his eyes squinting shut against the raindrops. i stopped my car and approached him slowly not wanting to scare him.. it turns out that the little guy was practically awaiting rescue. he meowed sweetly and allowed me to pick him up with no fuss whatsoever. He was drenched and shivered pitifully but as i held him against my body for warmth he purred appreciatively. Good thing i keep cat food in my car coz this little guy has a shocking appetite!! He immediately ate with gusto, meowing to himself as he chewed and swallowed. when he emptied the container he looked at me as if to say ""is that all?"". when we arrived at my parents' condo, nicholas ate again.. and again.. then immediately latched on to my mother and followed her around. he walked when she walked and sat when she sat. he climbed up on my lap for a nap, then he climbed up on my father's lap, then he climbed up on my brother's lap. Nicholas is not shy at all!! he's super duper sweet!! He has a nice long black tail and another special feature; his right eye is half blue and half light brown. his left eye is brown. how cool is that? For adoption to a safe and loving home.

I am unable to take care of so many cats as I'm always out of house due to work so I'm looking for kind, caring people to take care of them and want to have their own cats as pets as soon as possible. The first here is named Denzel, the cutest of the litter, but he's unfortunately not as smart as his other siblings. He's a little shy and quiet but is very playful with his siblings. They are able to eat wet and dried food. But for now, mostly wet food and slowly introduce them to dried ones. Denzel can already use the litter box, so he is toilet trained. He won't make too much mess. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.",4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17829903659396498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12693278545765652,0.15564454256143473,0.0,0.0,0.11812079299555026,0.0,0.3847959321845463,0.0,0.0,0.13948612764457488

History Kitten was found wandering near an LRT station and busy roads, thin and hungry. Now she is all bathed and clean. Medically, she is all fine other than being dehydrated & malnourished. Treated for diarrhea, all well now! Not yet spayed as she is still too young. Update: / As she suffered from extreme hunger previously, she has an obsession for food (goes crazy on sight of food). Now after 1+ month of training/therapy, she is much calmer, especially during feeding time. ^^ Update: / She gained g! (Now 2.05kg, only 1.3kg a month ago) Also, first vaccination given. Adoption Criteria Interested cat parent must agree to: 1. Spay her at 5-6 months old. 2. Keep her % free-roam indoors (not caged). 3. Attend to her health needs. 3. Treat her not as a pet, but as a member of the family. :) Also, please arrange to pick her up from our location, with own carrier ready. Play-dates can be arranged with no obligations.

002278114,2,2,115,0,"16 September update: Aura and Solar both adopted by Liz of Bandar Utama! Thank you! : ) Aura & Solar were rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . and after ensuring that they are in good health and well socialised after almost a month of fostering them, the 2 kittens are now ready to be rehomed. It's difficult to tell them apart as their coat colour and pattern are exactly the same but looking at their eyes, you will be able to differentiate both the kittens. - They have dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM September (RM12) at a total cost of RM30. - They have been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding them with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - Their weights are 0.55kg & 0.65kg as at 12 September . - They're eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - Aura & Solar have been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM85. - Aura & Solar's behaviour is perfect as pets as they're completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. They would purr happily when held. They are friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept them too) as they're well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The kittens must be adopted together because they keep each other company (and out of trouble). 2) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Their future when you return to your home country. 3) They must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Vaccinate them yearly to protect against diseases. 5) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 6) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover their vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Aura & Solar. If possible, please adopt Aura & Solar at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Aura & Solar, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate?

So I am tempoarily taking care of them until they get a new loving home. I currently have 4 cats of my own, so to take another 3 under my wing is just too much for my hectic schedule. It wouldn't be fair for them as well. They don't just need a home, but love & attention as well. I'm not charging any fee, but i'll trade them up for Cat's food & litter sand. The reason for the trade is that I want to make sure that the new owner is capable of taking care of them, provide good food & regular check ups & vaccines as needed. They are all litter trained & currently feed on Iams kibbles. They are very playful & curious little creature. Always wondering around every corner of the house.

She hissed at the baby. Even after post-op, when releasing both of them back to the wet market, she won't let the baby follow her. She seemed like going to hurt this little one.

04bad9310,3,1,0,0,"He's called Yoda because when I found him hiding above a tire under the car engine in the 1Utama car park on 27 May , he was just skin and bones and all big ears and eyes. The name proved to be very apt because he turns out to have tons of attitude, spirit and fortitude. He may be a scrawny under nourished little kitty, but he remains healthy, strong, curious and brave. And from the first day itself, he understands that he's been saved and shows his gratitude by giving head bonks, purrs and belly rolls. Therefore, he is suitable for a person who wants a cat with intelligence and a strong personality with an instinct to protect what he considers as his. Some important info: * His weight on 27 May when he was found was grams. * De-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 27 May. * Vaccination was done on 2 June . Another de-worming was given. On this date, his weight was grams. * Next vaccination is 2 July . The adopter has to make sure his 2nd vaccination is given on time. * Litter box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049683371658097,0.0,0.0,0.19118820725356606,0.0,0.0,0.11252701844318692,0.0,0.2891061083938562,0.0,0.21748537092964576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

He loves a lot of TLC and pampering. He really, really likes to be near people. Sometimes, I think Winky craves the human touch as he tends to follow me around or choose to sleep close to me. I have to give him up as the place I'm moving to is not pet-friendly. Winky has had his vaccine for the year, has also been de-wormed. Winky comes with the following items: Kitty litter tray, kitty litter scoop, shampoo, scratchbox, toys, leftover unopened cat food, leftover cat litter, nail clipper, kitty carrier, basket (which he doesn't sleep in usually), food/water bowl.

Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention.

She was sleeping under cars, ON car tires and IN car engines far too much for my comfort. I keep worrying that she might get trapped in there or get run over one day. So I decided to rescue her and try to find a new home for her. Little Stacey was a lost kitten I think, there weren't other kittens and no female cats around that could look like her momma. She was always alone under cars or in drains. Stacey is a feisty little thing, she will hiss at strangers, but will not usually bite or fight back. She is a very vocal kitten, hyperactive and loves to play with anything and everything. Stacey can be manja at times but most of the time she will prefer to run around curiously to explore every nook and cranny. She had been dewormed, but not vaccinated. Litter trained, and eats Fussy cat wet food + Acana kibbles. Stacey is a brown tabby with no tabby markings on her body, just on the head, legs and tail. The tips of her ears are black, so is her tail, which I suspect is from a Siamese heritage. She has white paws, which is very cute. :) If interested, please e-mail me at or SMS me at.

He never uses his claws except when playing or giving love nips. ♥ He's friendly around other (non-agressive) cats as well, submissive and calm. Adapts very quickly to new environments! ♥ Bagheerah been fully vaccinated, dewormed (twice), is scheduled for neutering. He is clever with the litter box and not fussy about food.

78b51f6a0,4,1,0,0,"If your cat is lonely, here is the perfect solution: a cat who loves other cats. BonBon was the only survivor from 5 siblings and was abandoned by her mother so I took her in. She used to be alone. I let her stay in my house with my other cats so she can have friend. She doesn’t mind being around with the adults and just be herself. She is playful, independent and sweet. Her energy level is high and she is very active. She doesn't really like to be cuddled. She likes to play rough. She doesn't meow a lot. She can get along with other cat; just give her time to adjust. She is suitable with a home with 1 or two adult cats. Younger kitten may be bullied by her because she is the baby in my house. Important : This is not an average pet, a cat who will sit on your lap, who love being petted and cuddled. I have her almost 2 months, and catching her to trim her claws or just to hold her still is an ordeal.But she really likes to play, all my cats will lose interest but she's the only one who still eye-balling the toys e.g feather teaser.She never comes to me and rubs herself just like my cats greet me. The only time she's interested to me is when it's feeding time or when no one wants to entertain or play with her. Sometimes she bites to get what she wants. I can give you some advice on how to handle her. If you want her to keep another cat company, she is perfect! And pretty low-maintenance,you can just give her food and water and that's it. Please give BonBon a loving home. With love, patience and affection from you, I'm sure she will be the most loving bouncy furkid you ever had. Please take note: Rm is imposed as a safe deposit which will be returned to the owner once the owners spay BonBon within 3 months.

d46569700,19,1,0,0,"Help needed ! Mosu Mosu is a mama cat. Her AGE is UNKNOWN. She has pointed colour. Like the siamese. But she is most probably mixed breed. Has blue eyes. She suddenly appeared where we live. So it only means one thing. She's either lost or like most pretty cats that end up here...abandoned. Mosu Mosu is special compared to other cats. Why is a cat like her out here on the streets ?!? She definitely must have been a house cat before. She is very affectionate, gentle and slightly cowardly dealing with other cats but very friendly. She gets attached to humans very quickly. She has never scratched or bit us. but once when I was unconsciously jiggling my house keys, she scratched me accidentally while trying to catch the keys.No wounds. so she plays too I guess. She trusts us waaaay too much. She got herself attached here and when she got pregnant she glued herself here. She behaves absolutely like a house cat ! Seems more intelligent than any other cats here. Maybe due to her mixed breed genes ? -Very well behaved and understands when we say ""no"". -When we let she uses the litter box. When we close it she goes outside to do her ""business"" I'm pretty healthy and had no signs of allergies so far despite having so many stray cats around. But lately I've gotten really sick. It seems I am allergic to Mosu Mosu. She's too furry. Only the mama cat(Mosu Mosu) makes me sneeze and have runny nose. But Mosu Mosu is attached to us and hates and refuses to socialise with other outside cats. So I am hiding the fact that she is making me sick from my family. So I need someone to at least help foster her or something because I don't want to send her to places like PAWS or SPCA. Anyone who likes a cuddle cat who is gentle and affectionate that does not cause trouble will love Mosu Mosu !",6,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12028344410666778,0.0,0.0,0.1034077207453626,0.08920004000815193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11504134339449247,0.0,0.0

71655dcec,36,1,0,0,"Mr CrankyPants is one of the cats in a feral colony that my neighbor and I care for. Unlike the others, he has become extremely tame and affectionate. While this is nice for us caretakers, it has made our sweet boy vulnerable to abuse. We suspect he has been intentionally harmed at least twice. Once he suffered a terrible wound on his chest that looked like he had been scalded with boiling water. More recently he became very ill and we think he was poisoned. Our neighbors have been complaining about the stray cats because they are pampered losers with nothing better to do with their lives. In light of these things against our little Cranks, it is with heavy hearts that we have decided to put him up for adoption. We love him but we are both full with our own pet cats and foster animals at the moment. I cannot afford to give him the quality of life that he so deserves and the attention that he craves. I think Mr CrankyPants would get along best as an only cat, or with a spayed female cat. I say this because he does not get along with the other male cats in the feral colony but he is just fine with the females. What's special about Cranks? Sure, he looks like an ordinary grey tabby but his personality is one in a million. He is the sweetest, most affectionate, and attention-seeking cat I have ever met and believe me I've met a lot of cats! He loves giving cuddles as much as he loves receiving them. When he has bonded to someone, he can't get enough of their love and he is never finished affectionately butting his head on you and expressing his gratitude. This cuddlebunny used to be the king of the colony but now he's a teddy bear. He's already been neutered and is healthy and toilet-trained. All that's left now is to find him his perfect human match. Could that be you? Would you like a kitty as sweet, loving, and loyal as a dog? Then Cranks is the one for you. Email or text me if you're interested. More pictures coming soon! He's pretty hard to photograph because he can't sit still! He's constantly rubbing his head on me and being super duper manja. Please, no caging except in instances of illness of injury. Cranks is a free spirit and he loves exploring.",6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.2879828305257707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.134306924074518,0.0,0.0980276887870793,0.0,0.0,0.11539167297548802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12642636715064492,0.28246328568133583,0.1034121554209128

b1c83d13b,2,1,0,0,"It was late at night when I was about to leave from work when I heard loud meowings near my car. I did not have the heart to leave it there as I saw no signs of its mother nearby. So I took it home and fed it with some food and gave it a quick wash. I went to the vet next day and bought a bottle and milk for cats and it has been drinking from the bottle. Not only is he playful and adorable, he is also quite clever as he has been pee-ing at the same place (in a shoe box laid with newspapers). He is always cleaned afterwards. A very friendly and active little guy, purrs almost all the time now especially after being fed (even knows where he can get his milk from!). Unfortunately, my wife and I are not able to look after him as we are both working until late night. We would like to find a home for this little guy, with or without a foster mother cat, as he can already be fed using a bottle, and can already eat soft food. As much as we are already attached to this little fella, we know that being in a house with caring people to look after him, he'd be much better off without a couple of busy people like us. And we would be happy to see him grow with love and become a handsome cat. ----- Updating again after we gave Sim away to his new family. My husband and I cried our eyes out from missing him last night. I still feel all choked up when I look at his pictures and videos. The night my husband brought him in, we didn't have anything suitable to feed a kitten with but an ikan goreng. As desperate as he was, we had to give him something to eat, so ikan goreng it was. And a few drops of Dutch Lady's full cream milk. The next day, we had only planned to drop him at a local vet, in hoping that a good samaritan would take him in, but the clerk said they don't take animals in, so we ended up buying the little fella a bottle and 2 boxes of milk for cats. Since then we had been feeding him the milk. We left Sim at home and when we came back later that night, we saw him sitting quietly at one spot. And we also saw spots of white vomit and yellow-ish liquidy stool. After immediately cleaning him up, Sim looked sleepy. I thought he might be tired from vomiting like humans would. So I wrapped him up and cuddled him. After a while, I thought something was strange about him. Usually he would wake up if there was even a slight movement, this time he didn't even stir. I also noticed that he squirted liquid from his rectum while he was sleeping. It was night, no vets would still be open. So I read up a website, at which describes a condition of a kitten from its stool and urine's color and texture. I suspected that he might be suffering from food poisoning (the ikan goreng and the Dutch Lady milk). I was devastated thinking that Sim might not last that night as his body was so weak, his head just lolled if unsupported, his paws were almost cold, all the signs I though that he was really dying. I couldn't bear the thought of seeing him die all by myself as my husband was at work at that time. All I could do that night was rub him to keep him warm and pray that he'd be ok. I was already so smitten by this kitten, although we couldn't keep it, I really wanted it to live. Miraculously, my prayers were answered when Sim suddenly got up, eyes wide open and started roaming the room. I was like ""were you playing tricks on me?"". It was really miraculous! I couldn't explain it if it's actually normal but I was extremely grateful. I still am today. After the gruesome experience, we went the extra mile to look after him, like looking after a human baby. Brought him a proper food for kitten, took him to the vet when he didn't pee and poo one whole day. As it turns out, he was still too young to pee on his own, so whenever he wanted to pee, he would let out signs which I finally figured out that if when he is meowing but wanted neither food nor milk, I would put him in the shoebox, stimulate him and if he didn't resist, he would proceed to pee until he is done. At first I have mixed feelings about touching an animal at its genitals but after the first time and seeing how at ease he felt, it really made me feel like a momcat. In those six days we took care of him, we were quite surprised that a lot of people were asking for him from this advert. For that, thank you all for your interest, it really meant a lot to us. The morning before we gave him up, I decided to give him a little wash. As I know that all cats hate cold water, I bathed him in warm water and he LOVED it, didn't squirm, didn't kick around, didn't scratch me for putting him in such a spot! At one point, I thought he wanted to immerse himself in the water. Haha! And then I wrapped him up and he fell asleep again before I fed him one last time. Throughout the one hour journey to his new owner, Sim just slept away. We really think that he is so much like a human baby who would fall asleep in car rides because of the aircond and the feeling of the car moving. :) Sim Sim... After handing him over, the new owner has been keeping in touch with us to ask what should she do if Sim is giving certain signs. I felt a bit worried if Sim's signs were misread, and all those sort of stuff a mom would typically be worried of. Text messages from the new owner saying that he likes to climb on top of people and follow them around the house, all the things Sim did to us showed us that he is settled at his new home and his new family. I tell myself that he'll be alright. It's weird that I have kittens at my parents' place but none made me feel like Sim did. None made me feel so emotionally attached like Sim made me feel. Though he might not even know us, what more remember us, we pray that he'll grow happily and healthily. Thank you Sim for the wonderful experience you have given us.",4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.04595581125284899,0.057580740978691376,0.0,0.0,0.06119153332451474,0.0,0.0,0.052606383505202615,0.0,0.0,0.043562836455441456,0.2670829970499474,0.0,0.0,0.040538595042245835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

138c79a01,2,1,0,0,I found this orphan kitten at a student’s house. They told me she doesn’t seem to have a mother anymore and has been begging them for food. It’s been weeks and there’s still no mother or owner claiming her. She’s quite skittish and afraid of people in the beginning that might be a reaction to how other people have been treating her. Which is why I finally decided to take her home with me. We already have four adult cats and can’t really afford to take in one more. So I hope she can go to a kind and understanding owner that will treat her well. She is a bit love deprived so she loves the attention and meows for you to pet her. She knows how to use the litter box properly and hasn’t caused any problems.

She is 1 of the 5 Little Black Beauty (please refer profile with this name before). When editing her profile, I was drinking black coffee, so I gave her this name, ha..ha.. Black Coffee 2 is a 2 months old female kitten. She has silky, black, medium hair but her hair is not so thick. She has a straight, long tail & sexy lime colour eyes. She has the smallest size among the siblings. She is a bit shy and will always let other sisters eat first, she eats later. She is eating wet food (canned fish) mix with kibbles now. She has her flea treatment done & was de-wormed today, 27th May . She is healthy but not so playful. She enjoys looking other kittens play and she will just sit quietly watching at a side. Her movement is very gentle, so she is very suitable to be an indoor pet. She is under toilet (potty) training now and could be let go at anytime. *RM 50 adoption fee would be paid to Cat Charity Club (CCC) for rescuing stray cats. *Another RM neutering / spaying deposit would be fully refundable once the surgery is done.

c98d16315,2,1,0,0,"I found May (on 6th May ) outside a sundry shop, alone and tiny with no siblings or mum cat around. She was just 3 weeks old. She was totally approachable when I picked her up. Took her to vet for some fungal infection treatment on her back and limbs and dewormed (8th May). She has fully recovered from any skin infections (luckily it was mild) and her fur has fully grown back to shiny black! She eats with a very good appetite and has been fed daily with soft food and now with good set of teeth she's nibbling on kitten kibbles. Was only the length of a TV remote control and now more than doubled up that size! Very playful, super active and adorable kitty. She is roaming freely upstairs/downstairs and everywhere cos she is very disciplined when it comes to her toilet habit and so far has caused no mess. Very clever! She sleeps on my bed at night with my other big cat. Her name came about cos I found her quite late at night in the month of May. Ideally, to go with her lively and playful personality, adopter should already own a kitten or cat to keep her company and to wrestle with and chase around. Adopter who wants to have May must be a good pet owner who provides a loving home environment and healthcare complying to the following pet lover's requirements :- 1) Vaccinations 2) Neutering 3) Lots of TLC!

No matter how much Missy hissed and spat at him, he just didn't give up there either, and persisted to try and make friends with her, it's all working out too, and they now can sniff each other without too much fuss! :)",10,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2359610325639545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2b0896bbe,2,2,100,0,"Cupcake and Cookie are two brothers that were born on 15 November . Both are now super active, enthusiastic over nothing and curious about everything. They are expert climbers and the adopters must welcome exploring kittens climbing all over the house and running up to their shoulders. They have to be adopted together so that they can be BFF and keep each other company when you are at work. They love to play with the kids in the neighbourhood. They are brothers to Caramel and Muffin: And also brothers to Jellybean: It would be ideal if they could be adopted together with Jellybean because they are now very close to each other. The adoption fee is to help me cover the costs of vet visits, kitten supplements, vaccinations and the spaying of their mama cat (done on 24 Jan ) and to give your support for the CNRM/TNM efforts for community cats. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-worm treatment was done on 6 December and 6 Jan . * Vaccinated on 20 Jan - 1st jab. * Vaccinated on 24 Feb - 2nd jab. * Next vaccination jab is on 24 March . * On 6 Jan - Cookie weighs over g and Cupcake weighs over g. On 20 Jan , both weighs over 1kg each. On 24 Feb , Cookie is already 2kg and Cupcake is 1.7kg. * Frontline anti-flea spray treatment was applied onto both on 23 Feb . * Able to eat solid food - kibble, wet cat food and chicken. * Litter-box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that they get regular good fresh food. * The adopter has to make sure that they are neutered when they reach 6 months old to ensure that they get a good chance at a long healthy life.

He is still with his mother but is becoming more independent and venturing out by himself. It's not a very safe environment for him to remain here as the road nearby has pretty high traffic day and night. His location is at Fraser Business Park.

302d37427,2,1,0,0,"Hi everyone! My foster mummy's friend found me in a storm drain with my brother and sister when we were less than 2 weeks old. It was raining and we cried for our cat mother but she didn't come. So, mummy's friend climbed into the drain and rescued us. Unfortunately she didn't know how to care for such young kittens so she passed us onto our foster mummy.. We were weak and sickly but mummy tried to keep us alive with bottles of kitten formula and visits to the vet. Sadly, my brother and sister died after two weeks when they caught terrible viruses. I'm the only survivor. Now, I'm strong and old enough to be adopted by someone kind, loving, and responsible. I'm hand-reared so that means i will be a great companion. I'm not afraid of people because they are all i know. Sometimes i think i'm human too. Because i'm hand-reared, i lack some of the skills that other cats have. For example, i do not know how to groom myself properly, the person who adopts me must bathe me and brush my hair every week. I also lack survival skills and i'm not familiar with any of the dangers otuside so i must be an INDOOR cat. My foster mummy could not teach me any normal cat behaviors but I am totally litter-box trained. It would be great if the adopter has another cat, a very patient one, that i can learn from and play with. Here are some details about me: Current diet: Royal Canin Babycat 34 Dewormed: Once, two weeks ago, to be repeated again soon. Litterbox trained: I use the litterbox all the time.

But before that please do consider the responsibilities of being an owner and decide only after serious consideration. There is no point in wanting these kitties out of impulse and then deciding to abandon or give them away later.

Together we can make this world a better place for all living things and help save lives. Interested parties please sent a message (via petfinder.my) / facebook private message / email and please share about yourself (eg Malaysian/expatriate?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets?

Please don't just provide a phone number because we won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. My apologies if the above questions seem to be intrusive or offensive in any way but we are looking for a truly loving and responsible adopter for the felines. All this resulted from our experience in rescuing and rehoming cats. Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either. It is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into a wonderful two way relationship.

We called out to him and he crawled out onto my hand like a child reaching out to feel a mother's touch for the first time. He was named after the car which was a Toyota; Thus Yota. When we found him, he was so skinny and was crawling from parasites. Fast forward to a month later, he is an active kitten with a doggy best friend/big sister. He is very vocal, very active, and definitely very brave. At times, Pipi has to find ways to avoid him as he would treat her as his scratching post. He is smart and also has a mind of his own. Yota can be a wonderful companion to a housewife or to children but will not do well with a working household. I am letting him go as I am part of that working household and he is locked in a cage almost the entire day to prevent him from running out and being stuck in another car or worse, run over.

319e533b6,14,1,200,0,"My people kept many of us. We were all semi long haired. I loved them because they were kind and fed us well. The small ones would sometimes make us toys from rolled up news paper and bits of string. They also let us out of the cage we lived in and I enjoyed running and chasing, climbing and rolling around on the floor. One day I had babies. My people looked at me a lot and whispered furtively. I did not understand what they were saying but I was too busy caring for my babies. One morning, almost a week after having my babies, we were all packed into a box. After some strange jostling and swaying, the box plummeted to the ground and there was silence. I began to feel afraid and began to wonder what to do while nursing my babies. When the boxed was next opened, I heard a girl’s voice. “Aiyo! Not again. Mummy cat and five kittens.” She picked us up and check us over. I was worried when she inspected the kittens but she seemed gentle if unimpressed. I was insulted as my kittens were the loveliest in the world, in my opinion that is. “Pity they are all short haired” said the girl. “The mummy has semi long hair, quite pretty.” I was placed in a room with glass walls. This I found most disconcerting as I was accustomed to bars and steel. I could see many other cats. They were curious and came very close. This made me very worried; would they try to harm my babies? Would they steal the food I needed to keep making milk for my babies? I missed my people. I missed the children who would play with me. I missed my cat friends too. A few days later, the girl, Olivia she was called, gingerly showed me a few more babies. My heart swelled. they were dirty and weak. Two black boys and a little calico girl. Where was their mummy, I wondered? I immediately cleaned them with my tongue and tried to feed them. With 8 kittens to take care of, I was too tired to worry or miss my old home. In fact, I was so tired, I barely had the energy to eat. “She is falling ill.” “Crap, what about the kittens?” “Not yet. But they will.” I heard them talking about us and making arrangements to take us to the vet. I hated being separated from my babies and foster babies. We were such a big group we had to be placed into two separate carriers. The journey in the car reminded me of my last car trip. Alicia drove us and she sent Reiki. I knew we were going to get help so I reserved my energy. “Her name is Tallulah, a Gealic name meaning ‘fruitful woman’ because she takes care of so many ” I heard Alicia say to the nurse. Over the next ten days, we were pilled, dropped and force fed. Olivia and Weng fought hard to help us regain our health. Two of my foster babies died but gradually we got better. “Shit! Two more in a box” said Olivia. “Tallulah Mama is too weak. We must hand raise” decided Alicia. Dr Bel agreed. But I was getting better and they crying kittens hurt my heart. When Olivia had them at the shop, I did my best to show her I wanted to help. I would pace my room and speak to her. She began to let the kittens spend the days with me but she took them home at night. I missed them and worried if they would be warm enough and if they would get enough milk. In the mean time, my babies recovered and began to play. A few days ago, Dr Bel decided I was completely better so Olivia let the two new babies live with me. I am taking care of them but they are very naughty. They climb and jump like monkeys and my own babies think they are ill mannered because they did not have a good mummy like they did. I will keep trying to instill good manners and proper feline dignity in my two new babies though I think it will be a tough journey. “AIKS!” I heard Olivia shout again today. I know something has happened. She usually sleeps, smiles and is slow and gentle. Now she is groaning and calling Alicia. She is very animated and distressed. I look out of my room and can see a box. I can hear more babies crying. I look at my extended brood of 8 and sigh. Can I do more? The answer is, “I must try.”",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3983214414175678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4962454610347342,0.08692778116775744,0.0,0.07444538764235101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Adopter requirements: Valentine will probably be fine in a household with other cats (assuming they are OK with him of course!) but he needs to have individual attention to stay occupied so not suitable for a household with many other animals.

She likes to be among people, responds when people talk to her and know how to use the litter box. There are a few drawbacks: She is pregnant(I'm not sure how many months), she have fleas, she have earmites, I'm not sure if she is vaccinated or not, and maybe she have worms.

6c399cb06,36,1,0,0,"How he was found: Bobby was abandoned and was roaming around our neighbourhood one rainy afternoon - all the kids were mad happy upon his arrival. People played with him, but, as night came and heavy rain poured in, all the doors were shut and nobody let the dog in. He was begging for shelter from house to house. Bobby's conditions (health, behaviour, friendliness & etc.): Bobby is a friendly dog who enjoys being petted and brushed. He is also very playful and he requires being taken out for a walk everyday. When we first found him, his health was at a very bad stake. He smelled bad and his fur all matted. He had sensitive stomach - he suffered from diarrhoea during the first week and couldn't digest kibbles. We fed him boiled chicken/liver and very soft rice for a fortnight and now he can eat anything (healthy for a dog). I trimmed his fur the first week and brush him on a daily basis. Now he looks as charming as the ones at a dog show. We noted several behavioural problems caused by the previous owner. In other words, Bobby's owner had abused him and kicked him out of the house. Several issues were observed, e.g. Bobby is shit scared of broom stick and he shows aggression as we wear slippers in front of him (was beaten by the previous owner with broom stick/kicked with shoes on). He doesn't trust strangers (especially adults); but with patience and obedience training and a lot of treats (what we did), now he jumps around us shaking his tail happily all the time. Why we couldn't let him stay We are a cat-lover family and we currently have 2 cats at our household (more are coming). As much as I love Bobby and try to help him, my cats show strong objections and disagreements against having a dog in our house. In the end of the day, I believe Bobby deserves a better/more experienced dog owner. Terms and conditions: There is no adoption fee and no money involved. You could take him to your home as long as you agree to/that - 1. Take him out for (at least) a walk everyday 2. Brush him on a daily basis, otherwise Bobby would have a matted fur 3. Strictly NO punishment in any form. You can correct him if he does anything wrong, but - you have to understand that he was abused by his previous owner and doesn't trust human a bit, therefore he regards punishment, aggression and violence differently - so, no punishment. What we do is that when he does something right, we give him treats and praise him (a little bit of drama and exaggeration involved); when he does something that we don't like, we show him that we don't like it and ignore him for a while. He wants to please you, so he will do anything if it makes you happy and avoid letting you down.

24cc193f3,8,1,0,0,"Fifi ni merupakan salah seekor stray cat yang berada di kawasan perumahan saya. Saya mula memberi dia makan semenjak 2-3 bulan yang lepas. Dia muncul di rumah saya secara tiba2 & dari entah mana. Saya pun terus memberikan dia makanan & minuman setiap hari. Umur Fifi ni saya tak pasti, tapi saya rasa dia belom mencapai umur setahun lagi. Seminggu dua lepas, saya perasan yang dia ada kurap sedikit di bahagian telinga jadi saya terus bawa dia ke vet. Alang-alang tu, saya ambil keputusan untuk spay/mandulkan Fifi sekali. Sekarang luka pembedahan pemandulan/spaying Fifi serta kurapnya sudah hampir pulih. Dulu masa mula2, Fifi agak garang & amat takut dengan manusia, walaupun dengan saya yang setiap hari bagi dia makan. Tapi, lepas bawak dia balik dari spaying ni, baru saya tahu yang rupa-rupanya Fifi ni adalah seekor kucing yang teramat manja & perlukan kasih sayang & belaian. Dia langsung dah tak garang lagi malah akan kerap datang dekat dengan saya untuk menggosok2 badannya. Pendek kata, sekarang Fifi amat friendly & sangatlah manja. Saya rasa sayang & kesian sekiranya kucing yang manja sebegini terus hidup sebagai seekor kucing stray, jadi saya nak put her up for adoptian. Moga2 Fifi akan dapat forever home & tuan yang akan menyayanginya dengan sepenuh hati. Tiada apa-apa caj yang dikenakan. Fifi pun telah di spay. Adopter hanya perlu memastikan Fifi akan divaksinkan & dinyahkutu & dinyahcacing dalam masa terdekat. That's all. Fifi ni seekor stray cat yang bersifat teramat-amat manja. It would be a pity if she remains a stray after her spaying surgery. Hence I'm looking for an adopter for her. Dia suka dengan belaian & sentuhan orang & akan mengiau-ngiau sehingga dapat belaian dari orang. Dia juga bersifat attention-seeking dan suka berada di mana sahaja orang berada. She needs a lot of loving. Please adopt her someone.

They need new home immediately so they could have the love and care they deserve. To adopt all together or to adopt each one of these felines, will be a minimal fee of RM 30 each.

I began fostering Gugurl in September out of fear that someone would poison the local stray cats. I kept her in a vacant apartment which was for sale, feeding and changing her litter box everyday. In December I took Gugurl back to my home and introduced her into my clan of four cats. Sadly, one of my cat, an alpha male hasn't been able to accept Gugurl and would show his hostility towards her. This has created stress in the clan. Therefore, in order to give Gugurl a happy life which every cat deserves, and to bring back harmony within my furry clan, I'm hereby putting Gugurl up for adoption.",2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2347420410843889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1740804780893533,0.0,0.167115098926259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19802454289798727,0.0,0.4490233873510487,0.0,0.0

d9f692e74,10,1,0,0,"""I was a breeder cat before being surrendered to my current foster mummy. I was unwanted because I was not good at taking care of my kittens and my very first litter of kittens all perished. I was never vaccinated nor taken out of my home and spent most of my life in a cage. Despite this, I have proven myself to be very trusting under foster care. I am eager to learn and crave attention in spite of some character quirks that require patience. Please read on to understand more about me."" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Details: - Female, 10 months old, mix of Coon (father) and Ragdoll (mother). Has a beautiful white + fawn coat with blue eyes. Character: - Fayja is a very loving girl and ADORES people. She has an outgoing personality and will adjust to any situation really quick. Loves to play, play, play and hardly tires herself at every invite! She enjoys being pet, stroked and even kissed (although not a fan of being carried). She will come to you when she wants a lap to lie on (she will struggle off if made to do so). - Fayja has a tendency to get overexcited whenever she sees humans and will roll around, purr and sometimes play-bite. She knows how to inhibit herself, however and will lick you afterwards. This instant excitement is probably from her previous life mostly caged - and lack of attention. She understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - She has a jealous streak around other cats although she is curious (big NO for kittens), will do best as a single cat. She dislikes others being stroked or pampered in her presence, will lay herself and nuzzle as close as possible to her person to prove this point. - Fayja has been vaccinated, dewormed, spayed and given Advocate spot-on. She is not at all fussy about food and is very clever with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Fayja ""nips"" as a show of affection very often, hence experienced adult owners preferred (homes with children will not be suitable). - She needs a % indoor home. NO apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire for more info, this is for any cats long term welfare. - Small reimbursement fee will apply, please inquire. Health card will be passed to successful adopter. Please drop me a text or WhatsApp if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this girl home.

Raised as indoor cats (litter trained) but loves the occasional outdoors after a few minutes of sniffing around to get familiar with the surroundings. The short-tailed brown cat is named Sleepwalker & shortened to Sleepy & shortened again to Cheepee :) Cheepee loves belly-rubs, playing chase with his toy mouse & gives this short cute acknowledgement when you call him while he's napping. The long-tailed black cat is named Munch Munch & shortened to Munchee & interchangeably called Wer-Wer (pronounced something similar to 'wear') coz he tends to meow that way :) Munchee loves the outdoors & chasing lizards & giving head-butts & loves taking a nap on my legs. Both also loves playing chase with a feather-stick, going round & round & round. I'm looking for cat-lovers who can give them a loving home. Their basic cat stuff & toys will be passed along as well.

I want to protect both from injure and harm and decided to find a good owner for putih, a good and wide area for putih not in cage, He is a sweet cat and charming,toilet train (he ""pub"" using toilet litter sand, He NO spray or NO urinate everywhere), he just feel unsecure with Kiko near him and outside, in evening is hot so, i don't want putih to suffer being cage all the way in his life. So hoping somebody kind and good, care to adopt him.For your info, I sometime let putih out from cage and locked Kiko in one of my room, cause Putih seem like unsecure and ready to attack Kiko if he see Kiko and of cause Kiko will try to protect himself. I cannot keep up with this anymore because I need to search for a job myself,my life and my husband,cause i am not employed for a moment, and will have to search for work soon,so I really need to settle ""Putih"" problem as soon as possible. p/s:(already adopted by welee lee.

74d7a26bc,7,1,0,0,"Hi everyone! Here is Sandy! She is a 6/7 months old female cat. We found the poor thing on the 1st of January in our garage. She was starving and was trying to get close to any cats or humans she would see. She was in a pretty good health then we understood that she got either lost or abandoned. The vet has confirmed that she had a family before as she is behaving like a house cat: friendly, cuddly, litter-trained and responsive to contacts. We dewormed her, neutered her, treated her against fleas and we made sure she regained the weight she lost. She is really easy to handle, didn’t complain when the vet checked her and when giving her treatment against worms. She got a flu but she is all clear from it since a month thanks to the proper medication. She is as perfect as she can be. She has a beautiful grey-orange colour and her eyes are bright orange. A gem! She also have some Singapura features. She won’t be a big cat (unless you ive her tons of food). She looooooves cuddles and to stick around her humans. Unfortunately for her, we already have 4 big cats and it is not enough attention to her taste. It is not fair for her as she is craving for attention and quality time with us. She loves cuddling up against our legs to have a nap. If you let her do it, she will spend the whole night against you and will follow you everywhere. She is not a kitten anymore but she has the same level of cuteness! We often rescue cats and find them a loving family. Sandy will probably be the most love-giving one we would have saved so far. As a cat rescuer, I will be careful to find the good match for her. She will be happy in a family, with or without other cats. We have a strict policy of NO caging.

All of us have graduated and are heading back to our hometowns. We would like to put Bubu up for adoption and would preferably look for an adopter who is: 1. Willing to treat his wound. (it's healing well and has dried up, just need to finish what is left of his antibiotic) 2. Must send him to his second injection for ear mites. 3. Must vaccine him. 4. Will preferably neuter him when he is of age. Bubu is affectionate (he's the purr-er type), playful, loving and beautiful (look at that fur! Its super soft as well). He has a bob tail which makes him even more special. 💙❤️ Please help share this around. We really want him to find someone who can love and care for him as much as (or better than) we did.

He would purr when being stroked. He would eat treats from my hand. He would follow me around at home and rub against me. He can get along with other cats.

Noel knows how use a litter box and is able to eat both wet or dry food. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Noel are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption.

Unfortunately they're very allergic to cats so i'm sweet pea's foster mum now. While i was driving to my friends' place to pick up sweet pea i saw a tiny furry lump in the middle of the LDP highway. It was Oliver! I dashed out and grabbed him then picked up sweet pea and off we went to the vet! What a miserable trio we were. Both kittens were weak, dehydrated, and sickened by awful intestinal infections. Poor sweet pea had scratches on her face probably from a run-in with an adult cat. Little oliver was bleeding from his mouth and bled all over my skirt. The good news is they're both well on the road to complete recovery thanks to my regular vets. Sweet pea is about 3 months old with a white coat and pretty eyes. Oliver is a growing 6 week old Marmalade male with a tiny midget tail. They're playful rascals who like to wrestle with each other and enjoy a nice warm cuddle with people. These two needs lots of attention and responsible, caring families to care for them. They need PERMANENT homes. Vaccinations and neutering/spaying are compulsory for adoption. These two have had enough horrible experiences with the outside world. They are to be kept strictly indoors.

95708d284,5,1,0,0,"Tom was rescued a few weeks ago. He was wandering around outside my friend's office looking for scraps to eat. The scrawny little tyke was skin and bones. He pulled at my friend's heartstrings and she bundled him up in a box to bring to me for fostering. He had a fungal infection and this had made him lose a lot of hair. After weeks of treatment most of it has grown back and he now has a lovely striped orange tabby coat and an elegant long tail. He is long limbed and lean. A white patch on his chest is the extra touch of cuteness that makes him irresistible. Personality-wise, he is very affectionate and playful. He loves attention and cuddles from both humans and other cats alike. Mischevious, he can often be found wrestling with my other cats or stealing food from my dog. Tom loves attention and doesn't like to be alone. It would be great if he could find a home with other cats or perhaps a dog. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tom are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter.

She is too young to be spayed yet. She now weighs 1kg, so she has put weight on and the vet thinks she is about 3 months old although still small for her age due to malnourishment. She is a very loving and clever cat. She worked out her litter tray straight away and loves to play. She follows us around and comes when shes called. She always wants to be close by.

162c1d98a,1,1,0,0,"Introducing little miracle, Kiseki! ♥ Six weeks old, plush-coated Ginger (yes, a female Ginger!) with beautiful hazel eyes. ♥ Kiseki is a fighter and one tough girl! She was rescued from a monsoon drain and later brought to the vets: where she was dewormed, prescribed meds and finally administered Frontline spray. Kiseki had a very bad (and rare) reaction to the (by label very safe) Frontline spray - which sent her into neurological convulsions. She had to be quickly shampooed, put on drips and just when hope seemed bleak - she woke up overnight! ♥ Kiseki returned home after and has been on treatment for mild microspores on her fur as well as delicate foods to help her disturbed disgestive system. She's now in back great shape and one of the most rambunctiously happy kittens you'll ever see! ♥ Kiseki seeks a home where she will be well cared for and her fighting spirit truly appreciated. --------------------------------------------------------------- Character details: ♥ Kiseki is an avid explorer, she's quick to adjust to new situations and loves loves LOVES to play! Her favourites here are our make-shift cardboard tunnels and string toys / balls. She has been great so far at entertaining herself (and us with her antics) despite being a single foster kitten. ♥ Being rescued really young, Kiseki is also extremely human-affectionate. She will grow into a typical lap-cat: loves chest-snuggles and especially having her head / ears rubbed as she nuzzles herself against us to sleep. She playbites but not roughly - she understands the difference between toys and human fingers although she does sometimes get over-excited. ♥ Kiseki has been treated against worms, parasites as well as tested negative against several viruses. She is very clever with the litter-box and is not fussy over food - still too young to be vaccinated. --------------------------------------------------------------- ***PLEASE READ (NOTE FOR ADOPTERS)***: ○ Kiseki must be kept INDOORS at all times (apartments should be cat-proof). ○ She MUST be spayed at the right age (there are far too many homeless kittens like her out there). ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). This is for her long term well being (please inquire). Drop me a text (WhatsApp) or call directly (preferred) if you feel that you may be just the right person to give Kiseki a good home.

1f34d9c73,2,1,0,0,"Miko was found all alone lying on a busy roadside when she was just a newborn baby. Her eyes and ears were still closed, her umbilical cord was still attached to her tiny belly, and she had no teeth. She needed to be hand-reared and bottle-fed constantly. After 7 and a half weeks of TLC she is now weaned, knows how to use a litter-box, and can run and play. Miko is very very attached to people and gets along well with them because she was raised by humans :) She is extremely affectionate and follows me around everywhere i go. She likes to be near people all the time. Miko is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Miko are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and spaying to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and spaying at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Miko started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please.

Please read their details below:- Fruitcake is a few minutes older than Marble & slightly smaller than Marble. Fruitcake loves hugs, pets, and fruitcake likes to talk.She responses with a meow, coupled with interested eyes. She cant understand you but she can understand your voice tone. She doesnt like it when my dog barks loudly in the house & she meows at my dog. A cat like gesture of ""please be quiet im trying to sleep"". Fruitcake LOVES fish and gets super excited each time I steam a couple of fishes for her and Marble. She loves running around the house specially during playtime & loves to be brushed. Overall she's a happy little kitty. Marble is younger than Fruitcake. She's the most playful kitty out of her siblings. Her big communicative playful eyes will surely keep you interested in her mischief. She learned how to play catch as a kitten & she loves it when you play hide & seek with her. She'll keep on playing till she pants like a dog & She'll always want to try on what you've in your mouth, especially ripe sweet mangoes, thats her fav fruit. She has issues with hugs (like most female cats do), but once she's brushed she'll ask for more and wont let you stop. Marble is also quite talkative, loves to eat and run around. If you're looking for a playful kitty, Marble would be fit to your preference. Note : FRUITCAKE & MARBLE'S BIRTH DATE IS ON THE 21ST NOV ! ** Fruitcake & Marble are siblings. Their mom adopted me to be her & her baby's caretaker. She just walked in the house, pregnant, and gave birth while I was her acting nurse. ** THEY ARE LITTER TRAINED. ** Fruitcake & Marble are inseparable. You can choose to adopt one of them, but it's best if you keep them together. They really adore & love each other. They are each others' motivator. ** They are kept in my apartment, never steps out my house and they have never been sick within the 2 years and 7 months (and counting) of their lives. ** Fruitcake & Marble both love fish, specially steamed fish coupled with a good fish broth. ** If you want to adopt them, please make sure to take good care of them. As their pet parent, I really care for their happiness & comfort & well being. ** You must be responsible & caring with these babies and you should tend to their needs, which they will definitely give you love, % in return. ** They aren't vaccinated & de-wormed.

f7bf646ee,5,1,0,0,"Hi, my name is Kimmie. I have a good life style and I'm looking for cat lover who can provide me with what I am enjoying now, not less but equivalent or more. In return, I won't give you trouble and will be your best company ever. About myself: I am about one year 5 months old female and weigh about 5 pounds. I am DSH and I have 4 colorful attractive colors on my body. My colors are very unique. I am not a lap cat and do not like to be carried around much as I'm independent. I need my space. Other than that I am a very good cat. I have been neutered. I do not shed much fur because I am very healthy due to my daily intake of vitamins. My vitamins are self fed. My daily diet is as follows: for breakfast I enjoy a can of fancy feast premium cat canned food followed by free-flow royal canin dry food as my in between snacks. I need to drink a lot of water. I am toilet trained. Please provide cat litter tray with a reasonable amount of sand. Please keep me in door and do not leave your doors or windows open. I am a health freak; daily vitamins of 2 capsules of yeast is a must for me as I am crazy about my vitamins to keep my body and color attractive. Not to worry as you need not mince my vitamins. Just put 2 capsules in my cat bowl and I will take care of it! I am very independent. If you can meet my requests above, please take me home and promise me that you will give me everlasting love. Please do not apply if you are planning to feed Kimmie with left overs food, friskies or whiskas or equivalent, rice etc. Candidates are encouraged to apply provided you are prepared to feed Kimmie with royal canine (sensible) and fancy feast premium canned food.

Then of course she'll need her spaying when she's at least 6 months old, she's only 7 weeks old right now.

The mother cat moved to our garden after she got the babies and we took her in to join the rest of our cats and kittens. I love cats but we already had one cat and just adopted a mom with 4 kittens, to take care of 6 is more than enough... The mom and her kittens deserve a new loving home where they can be given more care and attention. Bonnie, the mother is a nice long hair, very clean, calm loves to cuddle and never made any mess. She just got sterilized to prevent another pregnancy. About the kittens, we asked the vet, but it´s impossible to guess the gender yet, so we named them unisex (of course you can choose other names): Oreo is a very active and playful white and black cat, Marbles has pale red and black marks on its white fur while Patches white fur comes with many red and black spots, Marbles and Patches stick together all the time, so it would be great if someone could take both. But it’s not a must. Tiny, the smallest, is a white and red tabby, very quiet and a bit shy. Twilight, is not related with the other ones, I guess someone placed it in our garden. We were not able to locate the mother. It has medium long dark grey hair with a black tabby pattern, blue eyes, is playful, energetic and curious. It would be great if some of them could stay together. But as long as you are willing to provide much love, good care and a safe environment, we will separate them.

Nishi can eat solid wet kitten food already, and has a clean bill of health from the Gasing Veterinary Hospital; he just got dewormed today.

Pinky lives at the back alley of her house and she feeds the group of cats daily. Pinky is a very very adorable, sweet, friendly, manja and tame cat. She loves dog and is very attached with one of the community dog - Bobby. Bobby is a sweet and friendly dog too and she gets along well with Pinky and the cats. Unfortunately past two weeks Pinky dissapeared for two days and she was found with severe injuries on her back side and it bleeds badly. It was diagnosed as dog bite wound and we believe that Pinky might got bite by other stray dogs around that area..she might think that dogs are all as friendly as Bobby and would play with her. Poor Pinky is still hospitalized in vet clinic. The vet are forced to cut off her long beautiful tail as the tissues and skin of the tail were damaged. We're worried that after she got back to the back alley she might got bite again as she's too friendly with dog. Pinky definitely deserves a very good and loving home.

Has a diluted-calico (blue instead of black) medium-hair coat (will develop) with beautiful hazel eyes. ♥ Absolutely loving girl! Stroke her, carry her, hold her, hug her, give her kisses, anything, she won't protest. :) Jamaica bonds closely to the people who pay her the most attention. ♥ Jamaica's very vocal despite her teeny-tiny voice. Has a lot to say especially when spoken to! She explores her space and can even jump onto significantly high places despite her size - her favorite being her human's lap. ♥ She is a follower as well and tags along behind feet - very purry and gives us massages with her little feet. She will need lots of attenion as she seeks comfort with people often. ♥ This girl is very clever with her little-box and eats her kibble independantly. She has been dewormed (still too young to be vaccinated) and is in good health. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Jamaica must be kept % indoors for her own safety. Apartments should be cat-safe. ○ Spaying is compulsory (when she's older). ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire - this is for any cat's long term welfare.

I have saved many wounded and abandoned kittens and never had problem getting them a new home.. this has been quite a while since I posted this profile and no takers...

923a03e90,5,2,0,1,"Please send an sms before calling if possible because I might not pick up your calls when I'm busy and might not call back unknown missed calls. Or you can send e-mail. These two kittens are Beel and ToraRawr. They are kids of on of the stray cats we feed.We picked them up from the mom...she didn't leave them willingly but they were weaned. So I kidnapped 3 of the kittens kept them inside, gave them bath, fed them etc. The third kitten seemed too scared without the mom and seemed a bit fragile so I left them to them mom, and now a resident of the backyard alley. He seems to be happier outside. We decided to do that because we felt responsible as we feed the adult cats and many kittens we feed just die or disappear before even reaching adulthood being attacked by dogs and other territorial adult cats. Recently one of our precious indoor-outdoor kitten of 10 months went missing; very sad. We love the kittens very much and feel attached to them but unable to take care of them for a long time. They need lots and lots of love, care and time. SO for a better living condition and care we are giving our beloved kittens away for adoption. Kitten's Description :- I'm guessing these 2 kittens share different genes combination. Beel has medium body structure and hair length. More fluffier than Tora. Tora is the bigger species type with normal hair. Beel has a square shaped face and Tora has a longer face... 1. Beel : -Female -Tri colour Fur, fur slightly longer than Tora's. -Yellow/orange eyes -Enjoys playing with toys -Purrs when playing fighting with human hands. ToraRawr(Tora): -Male -Orange fur. -Yellow/orange eyes -Lap cat type. -Eats a lot.Will eat as long as you feed. That's bad. Don't fall for that eyes when he begs for food. -Quite vocal. Meows lot more than Beel. General : These cats will grow up to be quite big when fed well as parents are big and tall cats. Eye colour will lighten as they grow into adulthood. Please try to neuter/spay them to continue to maintain their tame nature. especially Tora as the stray male cats here start to get territorial and fight when grown up. But Tora seems very soft. So he might have been a loser if left outside with the other cats. Conditions to adopt :- 1) Both siblings Beel & Tora are to be adopted as Pair and not separated. One will go berserk without the other if they know the other is missing. They're close. 2) Not giving them away for students who live alone.A family is better. Only adopt if someone will be at home watching over them without being left alone too long. 3) Make them live a good life. :D",30,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09894400420953617,0.3973466897372556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003794969956074,0.177939194528115,0.0,0.0

A funny thing happened one day ...... I went to my home but no-one was there!!! I saw a big truck and people putting things into it ... even my favourite couch!!!! I did not know what was happening. Everyday I went home and no-one was there, and boy was I getting hungry. I have been fed by my people since I was a baby kitten, I haven't learnt to find food for my self and all the neighbourhood toms kept picking on me, I'm a lover not a fighter!! Then I started getting itchy, very itchy, think I had a skin disease and it was getting very sore, and had lost so much weight. Thankfully one of my friends, Chica, took me to her home and her Mum gave me some food, oh it was so good! She took me to the vet too! I had a jab and the sore itchiness is getting better. Chica's Mum starting calling me Elroy, it's a good name for me. I understand it is hard for Chica's Mum to keep me and she is trying to find a new home for me, and I am grateful. The other day Chica's Mum took me back to the vet and I had a long sleep, when I woke up I was a bit tender in my private area, I think the vet took my things off!! But I don't mind, I'd much rather stay at home with my new family than roam the streets and get beaten up all the time.

I have been keeping him for 4 months, but was recently given a warning notice by the condo management that MBPJ has started taken action in removing pets in apartments after a year of my stay. We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Zee (2yr, male, neutered son of molly) and Molly (female 3yr, spayed). As for Nova, he is 4 months old, male, not spay yet. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property.

I was on the second lane when I noticed a car at halt and hestitated to move. The road around 6pm - 7pm was very busy. Then I was astonished when I saw this little fellow there and the driver was trying to avoid it. Since the traffic was heavy and my second lane was also at halt, I went out and try to pick the fellow up. Well for all you know God was kind and as the little fellow started crawling under the car, the driver moved slowly. Other cars that followed also slowed down to see what was happening.As I neared the fellow it ran to the side of the divider and to the pavement. Luckily for this divider there was a big piece of land (pavement). Seeing that he was safe for a moment, I went back to my car and drove slightly up as I was blocking the traffic. Luckily I was able to park my car near a taxi stand. I took some cat food which I always have with me in my car and headed back to the kitten. When it saw me it ran away into an exposed drain. Oh! dear I thought, every where was covered up except this part and in he went. I inched up to him slowly making sure I do not frighten him.I extended my cat food to him and luckily this poor fellow was very hungry. It came for the food and I slowly caught hold of him.

The reason being is because I am moving away soon and my new place is shared with other people and I think does not allow pets. Another reason is financial reason. I might not be able to afford their medical expenses in the future so if anything, I will have difficulty to pay. The cats are Hinata and Mimi. Both are already neutered and toilet trained so can be kept inside. Or outside if you'd like because they like to wander around. Just make sure the neighbourhood is safe enough. Hinata - Female, Tortoiseshell, about 2 years old. Shy and timid around strangers but once she is familiar with you, she'll be very relaxed and lazy. Mimi - Female, Calico, about 4 years old. Jumpy and alert. Clingy and get attached with you very well when she knows you. There are some things I will provide for you. - Closed litter box with flapped door - Food bowls - Medical books for each of them - Cage I have to give them away within a week or so.

Has a blue tortie-tabby long-hair coat with gorgeous hazel eyes. ♥ Zabell is a curious little diva who likes observing things. Do not be fooled by her size - she can sprint in quick bursts and LOVES to play. Strings, paper balls, tunnels, she enjoys them all. ♥ First of her siblings to puff up and test ""strange"" things or new people in her space - she is very confident. She also has her own way of displaying affection - sometimes she's purry, other times she watches, sometimes she wants to be stroked by feet, others right on our laps. :) ♥ Very good when carried and rather rag-doll like. Not to be mistaken for a lazy kitten - Zabell is an energetic girl and and will need constant stimulation. ♥ This girl is very clever with her little-box and eats her kibble independantly. She has been dewormed (still too young to be vaccinated) and is in good health. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Zabell must be kept % indoors for her own safety. Apartments should be cat-safe. ○ Spaying is compulsory (when she's older). ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire - this is for any cat's long term welfare.

The two kittens are very playful, and very fun to be around with. All three are healthy, always kept indoor and all are toilet-trained. Reason to give for adoption is because I have too many cats already, and I have to put extra attention and care to one particular kitten which I bought not long time ago.With my busy schedule I will not be able to care for all the cats in my home as I have a very packed schedule these days,and also I live in an apartment. It will be much appreciated if someone could adopt them either all three together or each one of them. As I really could not care for them as much as I did before.

At first we thought it's just stuck together because he seems to have cold symptoms. then we noticed him running, climbing or moving around by completely depending on his nose and listening. This kitten has a calm temperament. He is a very gentle kitten and is not afraid of humans since he haven't seen how big we are. He climbs things and jumps too. He likes being pet and cleaned and purrs too. He recently learned to follow clucking sound we make with out tongue and follows. I am sad to see this kitten being outside and fear he might get hit by cars. He doesn't know how to avoid vehicles or anything big and moving fast. He will just get scared and sit at the same spot.

Even a temporary foster parent will help a lot. He is the only kitten who has survived from the litter despite being blind.The chances for him to survive here is scarce, especially with the cars passing. Many kittens have been road-kills here.

We prefer to give him up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter him and also take him for regular vet checks. He needs to be kept indoors, as He is very young and would not know how to survive outdoor. Being a new environment, he might also runaway if kept outdoors. He is very good with our cats.

Now she is under the multi-coat vitamins and Omega 3 cat food The SPCA lady told us the person brought her in said he found her with her male partner. i dont know if its true or not because she is heavy, healthy and very gorgeous cat.(rare to see stray cats look like this plus she comes in with her partner). the color and everything just like the burmese cat BUT miss Jensen's tail is 3/4 long meanwhile her partner have full length tail and shinning coat and he has been adopted (bless that family). Both are super gorgeous ;).

29a08292f,29,1,90,0,"Opus (his temporary foster name) was found in my backlane and believed to be abandoned because he was new to the neighbourhood, bullied by established community cats and did not know how to look for food. Thus, I rescued and nursed him back to good health. His overly-friendly behaviour and insistence to stay indoors confirms my suspicion that he was previously an owned cat rather than a stray. Thus, it was best for him to be rehomed rather than released back outdoors where he won't survive. About Opus: - applied MONTHLY with Advocate (latest on 19 September ) to protect against fleas and heartworms. - His weight is 4.6kg as at 26 September . - NEUTERED on 29 June . - VACCINATED on 8 July . - MICROCHIPPED on 15 August . - Tested NEGATIVE for FeLV&FIV on 18 August . - Full blood test on 18 August which showed GOOD kidney and liver health. - fed with PREMIUM cat kibbles (Monge - 33% protein content). - drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily for his good health. - TOILET-TRAINED to use the litter box. His poo is solid and well-formed which is an indicator of good health & good bowel movement. - domesticated, overly friendly, very AFFECTIONATE and constantly seeking attention. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 2) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 3) Apply spot-on medication (Advocate recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 4) The adoption fee of RM90 must be paid in full as it only partially covers the cost (total: RM!) of his neutering (RM60), microchipping (RM), FeLV&FIV test (RM) full blood test (RM) and vaccination (RM53). Your adoption fee will go to helping the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt Opus, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.",11,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.13373290580884553,0.0,0.12276971565226147,0.0,0.0,0.21109033859885748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10356652226183502,0.0,0.11741926016244728,0.0,0.09604467054612864

Thanks! :) 2 Fun, Affectionate Male Cats with Tons of Personality Seek a Good, Loving Home Good things come in two! Barney - Grey and White with Raccoon tail (10months) Chubby, cuddly, half-Persian cat. Extremely affectionate, loves attention. Will come when called and will automatically roll over to get his belly rubbed when you walk up to him. Will sometimes chase you when you run. Loves to eat, follow you around the house, sleep in cool/dark places (finds the best hiding place), wrestle and chase Hobbes. Also very paternal and loving with the little one, never fails to give him a good cleaning and a hug. And when he can’t find him, he’ll roam the house calling out for him (has the funniest meow). He’s a morning cat – will wake you up by snuggling his nose in your face. Hobbes – Orange and White(7months) Very curious, cheeky, active little kitten. He’s the adventurous, cunning one who will explore everything. You will be amazed at his zest for life. Has a handsome white tuft of fur under his chin, looks very regal when he sits. Loves plastic (sleeping on it, playing with it) and loves the sun (will snooze all day right in the beams of the sun). Absolutely loves balls of paper – can play for hours with one (not kidding). Finds the most random, funniest places to lay on – handbag, plastic bag, bowl, etc. Always jumps on Barney and starts wrestling him. He may be little but he’s got a lot of spark in him. Independent at times, but will always give in and seek the comfort of your lap. They’re both interesting cats with their own personalities and are extremely loving and gentle with humans. Have never scratched or bitten ever. No problem with strangers at all. Potty-trained. Very well-fed and healthy. It truly breaks my heart to part with them, but I have no choice as I’ll be moving out of the country. Please do consider adopting them as a pair as they really love each other. But if you have no choice either, you can choose to adopt one.

Fifi is an active kitten who loves to play around. She has quite a long tail and she usually loves to play with her tail, assuming the tail has been bothering her. She is able to eat solid food now and she is not the fussy type (as long she can eat). However, since she is an active one, we prefer her future adopter could spend some quality time with her and play with her. And, she needs space as she loves to run around (and knock few things off). Still, she is fun to be with. The reason of giving out as adoption: Actually it's my aunt's pet but her current place doesn't allow any pets in the house, therefore she needs to find someone who can take care of Fifi. I also have my own pets (quite a number of it), so I can't afford to adopt another one. Fifi has been vaccinated, and follow-up MUST BE DONE and she MUST BE SPAYED once she is 6 months old.

ef836c3d3,2,1,0,0,"Introducing gorgeous little Guinevere! ♦ Female kitten, estimated to be 7 weeks old. Long-coated Coon/DLH mix with pretty hazel eyes. ♦ Guinevere was rescued while she was trying to cross a busy street. She was very weak at the time:- dehydrated, had fleas, flu and also diarrhea. She was taken to the vet and consequently treated at home. ♦ Guinevere's recovery process has gone tremendously well! No more flu, parasite free and growing fast - only her still sensitive tummy means she needs a maintenance of her gentle diet until she grows out of the runs. Character details: ♦ Guinevere is a VERY loving girl. She's social bug and is not at all scared of her vets visits or new people / situations. She's curious about our other cats as well as our dogs! ♦ Do not be fooled by her size, she's a bundle of energy and loves loves LOVES to play. Strings, paper balls, tunnels, she enjoys them all. Guinevere does play-bite hence she'll need someone who can match her energy and teach her the discipline she'll need. ♦ She has already been dewormed and given flea/parasite prevention. Tested negative against any serious viruses, healthy temperature throughout and has gained a great deal of weight. Guinevere is still too young to be vaccinated. She's not fussy at all about food and is very clever with her litter box. ------------------------------------------------------------ [IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters: • Guinevere needs a % indoor home for her own safety. Apartments should be cat safe. • Spaying is a MUST - there are way too many homeless kittens like her on the streets. • Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Guinevere needs her bland / gentle diet maintained and possibly experimented with until her digestive sensitivity is sorted (as much as none of this bothers her one bit!). • Refundable fees apply (please inquire). Please drop me a text (WhatsApp or SMS) or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this little girl home. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated.

Brother to Demetrius (Profile: ) ♥ This frisky chubby-cheeked lad loves to play! He is the more vocal one and will be the first to meow as you enter the house. He ""coo-s"" before making his dash anyplace and its the cutest thing to watch. ♥ He takes a few days to adjust to new environment but once adjusted, he becomes the extrovert! He adores people and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken. ♥ This boy needs a little time to adjust around other cats (long as they are not aggressive his way, he'll take only a few days). He's as gentle as his brother and will not use claws harsly when playing with us. ♥ Floren is on the road to recovery from a mild skin issue he had post rescue and is otherwise a healthy boy. He has been dewormed, deflead and is very clever with the litter box. He prefers wet food over dry (although not a picky eater). ***PLEASE READ (Note for adopters)***: ○ Floren must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments need to be cat-safe. ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire to know more, this is for any cats long term welfare.

They both are well trained for toilet. So no worries, they won't pee or poo anywhere else. Age 1 year old. I've been travelling a lots and it limit my time and affection to them.

Do take a look at some of their pictures and I hope you would at least fall in love with one. I did bring them fir deworming once but was advised to bring them for a second time. I however do not have the transport and resources to do so. All the kittens have been weaned from milk and can eat kibbles. Except for the one with the pink nose.

We found these cats in our front yard (we put cat food in front yard for strays), about two weeks ago. These poor kittens had their whiskers cut (Apparently there are people who believe that cutting cat's whiskers will make them unable to come back - poor these kittens! That is just animal cruelty!) When we found them, they were so hungry and so slim their backbone shows! They are now perfectly healthy and active. We already brought them to the vet clinic and have them dewormed and deflea and the doctor said they were 1 and a half months old. They are still too young for vaccination though. These two loves to play and very spoiled. They are litter-trained and can already eat dry food. One of them is male - white coloured with black spots on his head and black tail. The other is female - white coloured with black and ginger spots, also have a black and ginger tail. They need to be resheltered as we already have 4 cats they get in a fight so much we have to put these two in the cage at all times to avoid injuries. We hope to find a new home for them for the kittens well being.

79db05f63,3,1,100,0,">^.^< Kayama >^.^< If you are looking for a kitten full of love and play then this is the companion for you! We found her over month ago by the road. She was starving, sick with flu and suffering from mange. After several weeks of treatment she is now healthy, although she has limited vision in her right eye. She is however full of enthusiasm and desperate to meet her forever family and start her new life! I have rescued many cats and kittens over the years and I have to say there is something special about this one. She is extremely loving, yet playful and entertaining at the same time. SHe loves to sit on your lap and look at you. I get the feeling she is genuinely very grateful for getting a second chance in life! Because she has touched our hearts so much, we are looking for an extra special home where she will get special care and attention. Because her sight is affected and she can't always judge distances, we would like her to go to a home where she will be kept as an indoor cat. This is very important. Other than this requirement, she would be happy with adults and children alike, and is happy to approach other cats too. As she will be an indoor cat it would be nice for her to go to a home with another cat so that she has some company whilst her human friends are out and about! It's always good to have two kittens together as they really do enjoy the company of their own species. Kayama has had her first vaccination and has been flea treated and dewormed. She is also litter trained but as with all kittens you will need to be patient as accidents can happen :) In adopting her you agree to make sure she is spayed at 6 months of age to prevent unwanted kittens, and also to keep us updated of her progress. Remember, cats can live around 20 years so in taking on Kayama you must be prepared to look after her for the rest of her life (including being able to pay vet bills as and when necessary). This is a serious commitment and only serious potential owners will be considered. Minimum adoption fee is RM. Any more than this would be greatly appreciated as we have spent over RM getting her well and healthy so any contribution enables us to continue on doing rescue and fostering work. If you would like to visit Kayama, she is living with us in Petaling Jaya so please do get in touch and we'll arrange to meet!",3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.14154667493047435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19272667573407634,0.27642580515155923,0.3700304345958596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0860854983394571,0.10961772475975072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10165638500392304

d181cbafa,3,1,0,0,"Hi, this is Miuw. She's been with me since about a month ago. I found her the first time when she was a newborn, she was abandoned by her mother together with 4 of her siblings. She was then rescued by a guy that lived in the ground floor (while I live in 7th floor). After around a month I didn't see her, she suddenly came to me when I was waiting for the lift in the ground floor. I just played with her for a minute and then leave because I think she was still belong to the guy (but the fact is that all the kittens was already released by him). The next morning I found her in front of my door and then she directly ran into my unit, until now I don't know how can she reached the 7th floor and found my unit but I decided to keep her with me. She is a very active and playful kitten. She has a beautiful pattern around her face that makes her looks so pretty! She is okay with warm water so its not difficult to bath her. Sometimes she can become so spoiled and demanding for me to pet her until she fell asleep (if I didn't do it she will keep chasing me). I like her and want to keep her, but unfortunately I have to move and my new owner didn't allowed me to keep a cat in the unit. Hope someone that would like to love and take care of her will gladly adopt her.

We are hoping someone loving will adopt him as we live in an apartment and will be having our first child soon. There won't be enough space as well as attention.

Olivia is very active, playful, mischievous & fun. She's friendly & playful with other cats, always ready to rumble. She loves to run around the house, so she needs some space. A bit demanding for attention. Very manja when she's about to sleep. Love to snuggle between the sheets. Olly is fully vaccinated & neutered, toilet-trained & addicted to tuna.

36ad4a880,4,1,0,0,"Introducing dashing little Ferauni! ♥ Male kitten, 4 months old (D.O.B: ). Has marbled fur and beautiful orange eyes. Father was a pure Maine Coon and mother a DLH (see final pics). ♥ Surrendered to us with a rather bad fungal issue several months back which he has since fully recovered from. He is now seeking a suitable new family. Character: ♥ Ferauni is a frisky boy who adores people to bits - however he will need time to adjust to both a new environment + new cats (as long as they are not aggressive). Constant attention and the presence of humans round the clock makes this process a quick one. ♥ When he's not rolling on the sofas purring, acting cute or asking for belly rubs - he LOVES to play. Feather and string toys are his favourite and he has quite some speed and jumping skills to show off. He even ""coo-s"" and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken to. ♥ Ferauni loves being cuddled to sleep. He's still learning to stay put while being carried (normally jumps off) but otherwise parks himself super close to us whenever possible. He is very responsive to being called and follows us everywhere around the house. ♥ Ferauni is healthy (has completed two vaccine shots + two Revolution spot on treatments, aside from his medical maintenance). He is very clever with the litter-box and not fussy at all about dry or wet food. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Ferauni must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments must be cat-safe. ○ Neutering is a MUST when he's older. There are far too many homeless kittens out on the streets. ○ Ferauni would prefer premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire if unsure, this is for his long term welfare. ○ A reimbursement FEE will apply for his partial medical cost + neutering deposit, please inquire. Please drop me a text over on WhatsApp if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this boy home. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated.

We have two other siblings, Cookie and Oreo, who are also up for adoption. We hope to find a new home within the next month. Our fosterer already has 5 cats of her own, plus other resident strays (including mommy) to feed. Jebat is a darling male kitten who is the most sociable and adventurous. He is a handsome black tabby with white socks and tummy, as well as a lovely long tail. Cleo is the prettiest and bravest among all. She has gorgeous fluffy white coat with creamy-brown marble patterns, as well as big blue eyes. We are currently on IAMS kibbles and wet food diet. We have been litter box trained (we're total pros at it!). We are clean and healthy, having been Frontlined and dewormed. We both like to play with each other and chase anything that moves, particularly toy balls and feathered teaser sticks. We also love cuddles and kisses, and our fosterer gives us lots of those. We would like to be adopted together and hope our new family will cuddle and kiss us all the time too! It would be the best thing ever if our new family could love and give us a forever home. :) Please contact our fosterer Aida at if you would like to adopt us.

d687c7171,8,1,0,0,"Hello.. feline agent Maxwell here! ♥ My rescue story is a rough one. I strayed too far from home a few weeks ago and got lost. I eventually found myself at a gas station and meowed for days. By chance, late one night, a human on a routine fill decided to respond to my calls. ♥ I appeared happily out of a thicket and ran towards him. He tried to shoo me away (seeing that I looked like someone's pet) but I followed him persistently to his vehicle, making it clear that I wanted to be rescued. ♥ Fast forward a couple of weeks, despite several posters and shout-outs, no one has come to claim me. I'm now officially up for adoption. :) ♥ Take me not for a weakling! No part of anything I've endured has affected me in any way. I enjoyed my post-rescue car ride and even had a ball interacting with people during my checkup at the vets (I was given a clean bill of health). ♥ I'm downright outgoing, adaptable and sociable (that's not just around humans but cats and dogs too)! I love to play (strings and feather toys are my favorites) and when not playing, I enjoy a good cuddling with foster-mummy. WARNING: I have a deep meowing voice and purrs that will melt you to pulp! :) ♥ I'm careful with my weapons a.k.a claws and that makes me a great potential companion for kids too. ♥ I'm not fussy about food either (will eat kibbles or wet food). I have been vaccinated (first shot), dewormed, de-flead (with Revolution spot-on) and will soon be neutered. *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Maxwell would like to be kept INDOORS full-time (if apartments, must be cat safe). ◘ Maxwell would appreciate some form of premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). This is for his long-term welfare. ◘ Adoption fees will apply (to cover is neutering & vaccination cost). Please inquire. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take this lad home, please drop me an email or text at my number. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated. :) Thank you!",4,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13776522001405853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

ee24b09bb,4,1,120,0,"This beautiful mix-Persian kitten has soft, fluffy grey fur (dense undercoat) and a long tail. The most remarkable thing about him is his very sweet and beautiful face. What makes him more special though is that his personality mirrors his face: he is sweet, gentle and affectionate (manja). He will rush after you to play and be stroked and cuddled. He is very well-trained with cat litter and is a good and obedient cat (not overly playful or boisterous). He will grow up to be a very handsome and large cat (following his persian side) because even now he is bigger than most domestic kittens his age. I hope to find him a good, loving home with people who will love him and can give him good quality cat food and chicken meat (his favourite :)as well as the ability to afford a vet visit if neccessary. Pls note: I must be honest and emphasize that he is a very fussy eater. He doesn't like cat biscuits and will only eat canned food if mixed with boiled chicken or fish meat. And not given the food he likes he will hardly eat and grow thin. He also has a sensitive stomach and if not given quality food (that means no table scraps) he will have diarrhoe. Despite all this his beauty, his playfulness and his very affectionate personality makes me hard to part with him but if you feel you can give him a better home...pls contact me.

If there's anyone willing to adopt and take good care of them please whatsapp me at. Details of Female: The female kitten is very playful despite she is a disable kitten. She is blind as we had to take out her left eyes due to infection and prevent any damages to her eyes. She had an operation and slowly is healing now. She finished all her medicines and is very healthy now. Her right eyes is blurry but still able to see. She is a disable cat and a special care is required. For now i just locked her inside the cage with her buddy and let them play outside in the evening with supervision. Potty trained and eats alot. She is not very friendly at first because she cant see whats around her, but slowly allow herself to adapt with human. Details of Male: The male is super playful and friendly and loves attention from people. Potty trained and eats alot too. Adoption is only to people who don't have any cats at home or people who can really take good care of them especially the female as she needs a special care due to her disabilities. They are very easy to take care of, we just don't have the time to do it so we hope somebody can take good care of them Preferably take both home because they are so attached and comfortable to each other.

0a7798d2b,2,1,50,2,"Hello, Blake Jr. here! ♥ I don't remember all the details, but I was a scrawny and starving kitten once, lying by a busy roadside. My foster mummy spotted and picked me up immediately (despite my hissy protests). I was wrapped up in a towel, placed in a carrier and taken for a ride. ♥ Foster mummy could see that I wasn't the type to warm up easily. A single flinch from her would send me running to a corner! Still, she came to visit me for socialization several hours a day (each time bringing with her yummy bowl of tuna). It wasn't long before I decided she couldn't possibly be of any threat! Foster mummy promised that she would would make me adoptable soon, so that I could go home to a great family. ♥ Three weeks into my rehabilitation, and I'm as confident and playful as any other kitten! :) I like rolling over and getting tickled around my tummy/rubbed to a purr-filled snooze. Mind you I can be an extreme cuddle-bug! I LOVE chasing string toys and anything bushy/crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, you name it)! ♥ I ADORE being around other cats too (don't care if they hiss or paw at me, I'm ready pester/follow them until my presence is accepted). The more around, the merrier! I must say I love my foster home, but it gets a little tiring having to share everything with the adult felines here! Foster mummy believes I deserve better too. If you would like to take me home, please contact my foster mummy ASAP (don't forget to read the notes below first)! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters *** ◘ Blake is not % secure yet. He dislikes any kind of hustle and bustle. For this reason, homes with active/young kids or crowded households will not be suitable. Single adopters, couples, or small families with mature children will be his best preference. :) ◘ Blake would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age, no exceptions. There are enough street-kittens like him out there and Blake does not wish to contribute to the whole problem. ;) ◘ Blake would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc), this is for his long-term welfare. The adoption fee listed above is to cover (only a small portion of) his medical expenses thus far. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take Blake Jr. home, please drop me an email or message at my number. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated.

e18cc7a60,12,1,0,0,"[ Update on Oct ] ""October"" is still available for adoption. He needs a loving home without any adult male cats. He is an alpha cat and dominates other adult male cats. However he adores litters and cares for them lovingly, playing the role of daddy and mummy cat simultaneously. He brought up 3 siblings when I rescued them age 1 month old. Now they are 5 months old and ready for adoption. ""October"" nurse them and thanks to ""October"" these 3 siblings survive without a mummy. ********************************************* I picked up October 09 (as u can see thats the time I picked him)at a market place at Sri Gombak. This poor fellow was mearly 3 weeks old and looked very sickly.I took him to PAWS so that he could be adopted. Despite having to pay RM50/- he will be put to sleep. I changed my mind n took him home. Only recently do I kn how to put pets for adoption in the net. The first meal that I gave him was simply a meal he had not had for days. He ate... n ate... n ate .... till his stomach looks like a barrel. He is with me since then and now he is one year old n three weeks (I suppose). He started to be aggressive as he matured. Even after spaying him for a month now he is aggressive. He would attack other adult male cats when threatened. If I managed to separate them he would turn his attack towards other female cats nearby n if I pull him away his eyes would focus on my arm n hand and will want to bite me. (He has bitten me before).Well this morning again it happened I quickly put him in my room n took another cat out, he came running after us n I manage to close the rm door. I am really frightened if he bites me again. He needs a loving home that has no other cats to be threatened. He is a darling to kittens n even allows the kitten to suck milk but will really put up a fight with any male cats. I really can't handle him any longer as I do bring in rescued cats to my place. I hope that he finds a good loving home with no other adult cats. By.. n by if I hv no other options I will put him out as strays (he will injure other stray cats then) or put him to sleep (thats my vry last resort which I am not too keen). Pls gv suggestions or advise as what I shld do. The best is hv him adopted to a loving home without other cats around. Well likes to play with kittens, like chasing them round the house or wrestle with them.",13,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1176196762877381,0.0,0.0,0.2470297527415342,0.0,0.13937449567597834,0.17828165047036992,0.0790083987102186,0.0,0.0

He doesn't complain alot, he just wants love, he doesn't care if you're going to hurt him. :(! Really! Great companion. He purrs when I'm near, or just by hanging out with me. Sesame is sometimes too brave, he likes to hang out with cats who aren't very easy with him around, wants to make friends he said, says he doesn't want to make enemies haha. Sesame's the runt, meaning he is smaller than average cats. Has a best buddy in the whole world, Peanuts. Peanuts: Follows wherever Sesame goes. Both Sesame & Peanuts are usually seen running around the field like in cartoons. Peanuts is very timid, craves to be around you, but just scared. I believe he had some bad past with humans. ONLY! when you close your eyes or pretend you're not looking at him, he'll come close, haha! Alot of times Peanuts squint his eyes during day time when there's sun, like as if he just came out from the cave, we just think he's hinting us for a pair of sunnies. Very CUTE meows, playful, he's the one who initiates all the games with Sesame. :) Just like Sesame, they like to hang out with bigger cats whether the other cats like it or not, says they want to make friends, not war. I'm looking for committed, serious, adopters. Adopters who will make sure they will be taken care of, ensure they will not run away to become stray again. They are both preferred to be given to the same adopter. Rescued by me, and I will be willing to get them vet-checked, neutered, and microchipped. Neighbors are feeding poison to the cats, there has been alot of dead cats around.... I suspect they did put some in the place where i feed the cats, but i was lucky to have seen it before the cats.. My only issue is that, Peanuts is very timid and might take time to get used to the future adopter, so they're best to be kept indoors all the time to avoid them being stray again. Both of them must go together to the same adopter. Kitties and I will appreciate your help so much.

They really suffered as their internal organ practically bleed them to death. Another buddy of mine was saved, but he now has permanent nerve damage and can never be released back to the streets. For my own safety my feeder mommy had to keep me in a cage now, so that i won't accidentally eat any rat poison that smells and looks yummy. I don't like being in a cage though.

I have been keeping her for 3 years, but was recently given a warning notice by the condo management that MBPJ has started taken action in removing pets in apartments after a year of my stay. We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Zee (2yr, male, neutered son of molly) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Molly, she is 3yr, female, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property.

7f6f8b365,1,1,0,0,"Boots, the formal wear kitty, was left abandoned outside my apartment block at about 3-weeks old. He was bottle-fed and socialised with human adults and children. Therefore, he gets along well with people including young children. He is a perfect kitten - healthy, playful, friendly and eats with a big appetite. He enjoys hanging out with humans and seems to like smelly feet. He is, therefore often very close to your legs, so the adopter must be always careful to check where he is before stepping! Boots purrs loudly, but has a surprisingly soft and gentle meow even when he is yowling for his nom noms. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 18 June. * Vaccination has to be given when he gets bigger - when he reaches about 2-3 months old. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets quality fresh food so that his tuxedo coat looks like its made of satin and silk all the time. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life. Please email or sms me if you are interested to adopt. Give your name, where you live and work and the reason why you want to adopt.

Neglecting him would have meant leave him to a slow and painful death. I looked after the cat, and his recovery's been great, but still under antibiotic as the biggest holes hasn't sealed completely, hopefully he'll be healed by the end of this week. I am a traveler, and I must leave Malaysia as my visa expires. We've come all the way to KK to find a real home for him, as I am not allowed to cross into other country with the cat. Michi is male, small size, half-short tailed, about 3 years old, and healthy (no skin deseases). He is quiet, sweet, adorable, not picky with his food, and most importantly LOW MAINTAINANCE. It's hard for me to leave him, as he's the most caring thing I have seen in cats. We had great adventures: we hitch-hiked for two days from somewhere near Tawau, to get here. So you can add ""well traveled"" to his qualities. I must leave KK by Sat 11th Aug. Still after this date, please contact me, as I may not have found a place for him. Do you think you can give him a second chance?

3a64a5704,3,1,0,0,"Bobo is a cute and lovely girl. She is a stray cat, who lives with a lot of cats in the compound of a friend. In october she was found with an injured leg, so we took her to the veterinary. Her leg is healed very well, she now just has to build up leg muscles again, because she did not use this leg for about 2 weeks - best way to train is to play ;) She is well socialized: - loves humans: loves to be petted, likes to give kisses nose to nose, is cuddling and talking - very patient (had to take a lot of medicines and still loves me ;) - not afraid of noises - using litter box perfectly We can not keep her, so we needed to put her back in the compound, when the leg had healed. Update 6th Nov : Bobo has developed some skin problems, it turned out to be a fungus called ""ringworm"". She is treated with medicine against it. Bobo received her first vacination yesterday. She is back in the compound, where the guards are caring for the cats, they are providing food and fresh water. There is also another cat in that age, certainly Bobos sibling. And there is a highly pregnant cat around too... Will check her status every now and then... Update .16 Bobo definitly lost weight - she has grown so nice under our care :( Maybe loss of appetite because of medicine or she does not get enough food...she is the smallest cat around! Still hoping to be adopted... Update 17th November: The skinproblems are gone XD, hair is growing back very fast! She needs to take pills for 6 more days and get powdered 2 more weeks to really get rid of the fungus. Great recovery, tough girl! She is always around the guardhouse, when I visit. As well as her sister, a beauty in white and orange (see photo below and further profile). She is always coming to me too :). They are very different in character, but I think they are a good couple! Can be adopted together ;) Both are so friendly, bonded to humans and love to be petted! But definivly too skinny... I hope to find a serious adopter who will give her a nice home, love and a healthy life with good cat food, prevention of ticks, fleas and worms, medical attention if needed in future and after all a friend to play with! She should be further vaccinated and neutered.

Cardi is a typical princess - a little standoffish at first, but a sweetheart once you get to know her and she loves roughhousing with her brothers! And then there's little T'Challa - for a cat that's named after a superhero he is a little timid and shy, but give him some time and attention and he'll be loyal to the end. Plus, look at that cute little face! While we are ideally looking for someone who will adopt them as a trio, we will also consider anyone who wants to adopt them in pairs or individually. But fair warning, the kittens are very skittish and timid - we only found them when they were 1 1/2 months old and they aren't quite used to humans yet. They require alot of time and patience to let them warm up to you so if you don't have that then they might not be suitable for you. But trust us, with time and patience and alot of love, you will see how incredibly sweet and lovable they all are. Also, a household with small children is not advisable as skittish/nervous kittens don't work well with little tykes.

835fdb873,6,1,0,0,"Are you ready for the cat-parrot? I found Wonky sitting on the step of a betting shop in SS2. He was soaking wet, shivering, full of worms and with a snapped back leg (it stuck out at right angles to his body). It looks to me like somebody stamped on him, whether accidentally or on purpose I don't know. He was too cute to leave sitting there. I took him to the office, and we all nurtured him back to health. For a while we thought his leg might need to be amputated, but he quickly sorted himself out, with a little help from the vet and a lot of love from everybody in the office. Now he's a healthy happy kitten, with insane amounts of energy. He's still a little bit wonky when he runs and pounces, but basically he's % tip top. He's very affectionate, loves people, hates being alone. He's a real lap cat who also loves nothing more than riding round on my shoulders, falling asleep on people and stopping us from doing work. Anything that moves is chased, he'll be a great mouse/cockroach killer. He's fun to play with. He also likes being around other cats. He can be a bit naughty, but is cute enough to get away with it, and he's only young. He's completely house trained, he uses the litter tray (he's most particular about this, was the easiest cat to train I ever had). Sadly he lives in a place of work, where we can't give him enough attention because we're all busy (basically watching him play is a massive time waster for all of us, a great excuse not to work, but). Also, since the office is empty at night he gets lonely and howls. He really needs a loving home, where he can sleep indoors where people are. I wish I could keep him, but it's not fair to Wonky. We're going to get him neutered and vaccinated this week. Please give a call if you want a loving furball in your life. Only nice people who can give him a loving home need apply. We'll want to meet you first, since we all want him to go to a safe place where he can be his crazy self.",9,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.13287629916661714,0.0,0.0,0.19866295664980946,0.0,0.0,0.09046064640800436,0.0,0.0,0.21296850831883626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09542947040340503

Very attached to each other, these girls adore fun & adventure! ♥ Hand-raised from the age of 2 weeks and are thus very comfortable around people. They are also good with other cats and are particularly fond of their canine uncle Bobby! ♥ Baloo & Bagheera are in good health and have been vaccinated (first shot) and de-wormed. They are currently on RC Babycat kibbles and are clever with the litter-box. Note for potential owners: - The Blueys are to be adopted TOGETHER only. - New adopters must agree to spay Baloo & Bagheera once they reach an appropriate age. - The Blueys must be kept INDOORS at all times to avoid unwanted accidents. - Adopters must have a steady vet clinic in case of emergencies, and a good history with cat care. Please drop me an email or call if you feel that you may be just the right person for these darlings.

I also have very unique colouring - I'm totally white except for 4 black patches; my ears, a patch on my left elbow, and my bushy mid-length tail. My best asset is my eyes -- black corneas set against sky blue. I was found in a drain, and my vet said I have a bad case of conjunctivitis. Apparently, the virus is very strong as it's the rainy season now. I'm on medication, am getting much better, although I am really bad with taking my pills. :P I like to eat but I am more of a gourmet kitty rather than a gourmand as I will firstly, take a deep breath (hmmm...there's just something about the smell of sardines and mackerel fish), gently nibble and then, slowly savour my food till I clean my plate.

94b6d93ea,5,1,150,0,"Chloe is a little white/cream/gray kitten found alone across a big main road at night, attracting the dogs of the entire neighbourhood who were all barking at her, especially our own rescue dog. When I got to her, she was shy but then warmed up quickly to friendly petting. From petting, she was partially covered in mange, her ears & face crusty and loosing fur. We took her in and gave her the medical attention needed to cure her of that nasty skin problem (also to avoid having all the other stray cats being infected as well). We suspect that she was dumped out by someone when her mange infection got worst. Few weeks later, after the last of the mange, Chloe's fur grew back and she is now a beautiful kitten growing normally. While our other rescue dog was still around, Chloe would sneak out to play with the dog too. Chloe's got a distinctive gray pattern on her left eye, and cream pattern on her right. A gray comet-like pattern on her white-cream head, and a beautiful fluffy tri-coloured tail of mostly gray tones. She has pale blue eyes, her fur is medium-long 80% white, paws pink with patches of dark gray/black. Chloe is used to being around people, loves to play on her own or with us and will not hesitate to ""tell"" you when she is hungry or in need of affectionate pets. If her usual toys won't keep her busy, she is also a curious kitten, who would love to follow us around just to see what we are up to. When we are away for a while, we'd come home to find her sitting by the gate, waiting for us. Eversince the viral cat flu, we have kept Chloe indoors all the way, to which she's got no problems. Chloe is fully vaccinated, dewormed, checked for fleas (clean!) and has recently been spayed. We would like to find Chloe to find a good home and family who will love to have this curious kitty & take care of her throughout. We have no doubt that Chloe will be a great little vocal companion to your life if you're looking for a furry friend to call your own. The reason for the adoption fees : 1.

They are part of the 5 kittens born at my place, so it would be preferable if they are adopted with at least one of his brothers/sister, as below: Saffron: Sesame: Sundae: The main difference between Sago and Sugar is their character. Sago is the gung-ho adventurous kitten. He is always the first kitten to pop out of the cage when it's opened. And the first kitten to explore new areas. Sugar will usually stay behind at familiar spots and is more timid. Sometimes Sugar can be identified by his softer tail with a slight curl at the end.

They have been treated for mange, fleas, and worms so far. Their skin looks a bit sad in the photos because of the mange. It'll get better in a week or so! The 3 kittens up for adoption are Riley (black and white, girl), Aspen (cream, boy), and Reagan (black and white, boy). They are all 6 weeks old right now and will be ready to go to their new homes at 8 weeks. The RM50 will be returned to you when you spay/neuter the kittens at 4-6 months. Absolutely NON negotiable! These kittens MUST be sterilized. No exceptions. They must also be vaccinated at the appropriate ages. They are all very friendly and playful. Will not bite or scratch.

He doesn't get scared easily and is very calm. He looks like he's always thinking about something and analyzing the situation! He's a very confident and independent little kitty. Riley - She always makes the MOST noise! Especially when she eats. All you hear is *slurpslurpslurp* *nomnomnomnom* It's so cute! She LOVES to eat. She's becoming kind of pudgy too! But she's very playful and adventurous too. Likes to climb everything and play hide and seek/wrestle with the others. Reagan - He's the quiet one. He is a little shy, but he LOVES being picked up and petted. He ALWAYS purrs when I pick him up and he will sit on your lap indefinitely! He just loves being around people and being held. He's such a sweet little kitty. I call him the cuddlebug!

bce0e17b9,2,2,0,0,"A couple weeks ago two kittens were found by my aunt's colleague in her car engine compartment. She wasn't sure when the kittens were placed there, but she knew the poor kittens had at least traveled one journey in there, probably traumatized beyond belief. Since the lady did not know how long the kittens were there, she could not know where they came from and where their mother is, and this is when my aunt called me for help. I named them Nobu (the white one) and Yoshi (the orange one) after Japanese warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Strong names for two strong boys. Nobu had an eye infection at the time of rescue, but had cleared up now with eye ointment. Both kittens had also been dewormed at the same time. They are currently about 1.5 months old to be accurate. I had successfully weaned them off milk, and they can eat kibbles on their own now. (RC baby kitten) Though they do still enjoy milk on the occasion. They are litter trained, though can still get messy at times kicking litter all over. Yoshi the orange tabby is the older brother, the bigger of the two. He has the CUTEST round eyes and can be quite manja. He is more mild mannered compared to Nobu, but is a fast learner. He purrs loudly. Nobu is the younger one but he is also the adventurous one. He is extremely curious and likes to explore wherever he can get to via whatever method he can. (jump, climb etc) However, he can be a bit messy, spilling kibbles all over, getting milk beards, stepping into the water bowl etc. He has a super cute 'mew' though! Both kittens are extremely playful, Yoshi especially LOVES to play with feathers. They can also be potential lap cats. I used to bottle feed milk to them on my lap sitting on a small stool, even though I don't now since they broke their milk bottle, sometimes they still like to climb onto my lap and I'll pet them. ******SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY****** - It would be most preferable if they can be adopted together, I don't want to split the two brothers since they are quite attached to each other. - They must be spayed at the age of 6-8 months. - The brothers must be kept INDOORS since they do not grow up on the streets and are not street smart. If interested, please e-mail me or SMS/Whatsapp me at.

I found them about a month ago (8/7) when I was out on my run near my house and they just appeared out of nowhere from an abandoned house. They looked really scared and hungry and was as if pleading with me to help them; didn't want to let me go and kept following me. So I took them home and they have been under my care ever since. Unfortunately I cant keep them (as much as I would have loved to) as a family member is allergic. They're fed only with special cat food and they have very good appetite. I'm not sure of their exact age but I'm guessing they might probably be around 3-4 months and they're both female, and I presume they're siblings. I would prefer that they find a proper home and if possible, they stay together. Hate to see them separated! Please adopt them!

If they don't then please feel free to return to me. Any expenses during these weeks will not be refunded. - Adopter will need to pick up on the agreed date. (negotiable) ""Please remember that animals are living souls. They need consistent care, attention and boundless love. They will grow up, make messes and trouble, you will need to be willing to spend some money on their food and medical just like they are your children. They will love you if you love them equally. If you are serious about adopting a family member and you are willing to spend time, money and effort to take care of the kitten then by all means contact me."" ............................................................................................................... About the kittens. Currently fostering these two lovelies. Grew up with their momma's milk. Socialised with humans but are a little timid in the beginning, I mean who wouldn't be scared of giants being this tiny right? - Female : black tone, 'manja', replies when you talk, a lil timid at the beginning but gets playful later on, has a unique rough voice. - Male : lighter, more manja, soft meow, loves neck and back rubs. - Both are very healthy and clean. Both grew up together so they are very attached together. Most of the times they are very quiet either sleeping together or exploring together but when they see me, they will start calling and approach careful at first. - Both are around 1.5 months to 2 months old (Jun ) Video and images are attached. I am in Bandar Utama. I prefer whatsapp but calls and messages are fine. :)",8,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.24202705362270746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11287446913254574,0.0,0.0823846083020474,0.0,0.07908820171858075,0.09697767943965388,0.0,0.08305217091194432,0.07359770030972164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My mechanic was the one who first rescued her though, so I thought I’d help him find her a good home as I'm usually not at home. In addition, I am partially allergic to pet dander, which is a skin rash condition that flares up if exposure is prolonged. I would love to give her hugs because she is an intelligent and loving baby but my condition requires me to limit physical contact. Josie is also already weaned, now eating Iskhan (holistic Korean) kitten kibbles and also wet canned food. Playful, smart, affectionate, sweet natured and active, she will be ready for adoption once she is dewormed and vaccinated. Potential adopters may contact me at (voice calls only) or at via SMS and whatsapp. I’m located in KL but meet-ups can be arranged in most PJ, KL and Melaka city areas. All pre-adoption/fostering costs will be borne by myself. Pre-adoption/Fostering costs covered include : Deworming, vaccination, Advocate, de-flea/de-ticking and flu medication. Spaying costs would be shared with the adopter. UPDATES + ADDITIONAL INFO AS OF 13 SEPT : - Toilet-trained in under 15 mins! - Not picky with food.

39c654eaa,36,1,0,0,"This lady cat has a sad story. She was in a family, being well taken care of. Then, her family left Malaysia… and dropped her in our condo garage. She has been surviving there for approximately 2 years, having 4 litters. Thanks to a lot of patience, we managed to get closer, feeding her and giving her some cuddles. Last week, I finally managed to catch her to get her neutered and vaccinated. She must be around 3 or 4 years old. She is a tokinese mix breed. She has beautiful green eyes, and a black-brown fur. She is litter trained. She would need a family that has experience with cats and a lot of patience. She had to learn to survive the hard way and she is now quite suspicious of humans. But, she has shown a lot of love to us which brought the decision to try to find a family for her, to avoid releasing her. We are going to keep her one more week to give her the time to heal properly. If we found no takers by Sunday, she will be released. We are putting a lot of time and money to save the cats around our condo. To that extend, we are only considering the family who are doing no caging. Having been in the streets, she will not bear to be caged, even for the night. Moreover, we want a family that will keep her indoors at the beginning, the time that she is learning back to be a domestic cat. She will need your love and your patience in order to feel secure again. If you want to give her a new start in life, please contact me before Sunday the 22nd (April).",5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13235701941434913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0943894841031764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09877374753467376

Our plan is to neuter him once he got healthier. At the time being, we hope we could find him a loving home as he is currently taking shelter at our studio. He is a very manja, tame and friendly cat. Seems to understand simple instruction, so we suspect he was an indoor pet. 1) Must be kept INDOORS only. 2) Must not be allowed to roam freely outdoor. 3) No caging. 4) Must be provided with all the daily necessities; food, water, shelter, attention and playtime. 5) Must follow up with check ups; vaccines, deworming, etc. 6) The new owner must keep the rescuer updated about the kitten's vaccination card and appointment dates so that the rescuer is aware that the owner is fulfilling his/her duties and responsibilities. If you can’t adopt, we hope you can share our post widely because who knows, his future paw parent might be nearby. :) Location : Petaling Jaya",3,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.21750365469194188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17165902377473866,0.0,0.21238090863370196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14927381408863186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In front of Wisma Tractors, I noticed a black velvety furry ball by the side of the road as many cars were driving past. As I got closer I saw 2 twinkling lights from the furry ball. I quickly did a U turn and crossed the road to find it was this little kitten, shivering in fright but not running. It was just lying 6 inches away from the wheel of passing cars. I picked it up and took it to my car. The kitten was very afraid of the vet and wet itself and started hissing in fear, but it was fine when I picked it up. The vet said one leg is broken and needs complete rest for 1 month. As my home was under renovation I could not take it home, so it has been looked after by the vet for 6 weeks now and I will pay them. It’s now time for it to have a home and has lost weight because it doesn’t like being caged. It is a very well behaved kitten.

8c1658988,5,1,150,0,"Update on the 18th of October: Parsley has grow up quite a bit during the last few weeks. He had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so I need to reclassify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. He had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less specked. Parsley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. He'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. Parsley has a good appetite and doesn't meow much--only when he's hungry. I've also de-wormed him today. I fostered Parsley from SPCA. He has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. He is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. All the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). What is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. He learns fast: When he meows too much and I shush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's meowing, but with very little sound. That's sweet. Parsley is playful. I'm currently feeding Orijen to Pasley; I feed it to all my cats these days. I used to feed my own cats Royal Canin Hair & Skin, but after I realised it wasn't the best quality food I changed to Origen straight away. I was feeding my rescued cats Acana, but switched to Origen when I found that Acana was often out of stock. I also give cats mineral water/filtered water as I don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. The adopter has to agree to bring Parsley back to me to be neutered around mid January next year. I will pay the neutering fee. Neutering/spaying cats can reduce the number of strays. Many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. Unneutered males can get many females pregnant during the mating season, so please support neutering/spaying to save lives All the adoption fees will go to trapping and neutering/spaying other strays. The cats I catch will either be returned to nature (TNR), or their photos will be put on PetFinder to be re-homed. A cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. It is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. Please DO NOT dump them if they are not cute anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. Please give me a ring or sms if you are interested. Thank you. Here is a bit of information about cat food: Cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. The common brands of cat food--such as Friskies, Smartheart, and Whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredients and are awfully bad for cats. Corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. Well known premium brands, like Royal Canin and Science Plan, also contain corn/maize. I'm unhappy with these companies because their products are pricey, but the quality isn't excellent to match! There are a few other brands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to Royal Canin and Science Plan: Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance, Evo and Feline Caviar(Holistic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality.",30,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0592342304415945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06349963733197404,0.0,0.0,0.04819075178059671,0.0613641166810748,0.0,0.0,0.07771928310707787,0.0

We at first thought that Picasso is a male (oops ;p we're not good in identifying sex of kittens) and so we gave a male name. But in fact Picasso really looked like a boy when she were young - she was aggressive when playing, always love to disturb the other cats & acts in a boyish way. Picasso was being rescued from roadside several months ago, we saw that there's a man stood there kept trying to kick Picasso away, she was just a tiny baby asking for foods that time! We sent her to vet for medical check up and found that she got real severe virus infection on stomach and she had diarrhea for over 2 weeks even after she took medications. Picasso is a big and healthy girl now and she started to really look like a girl..she's independent, smart, active and always love to play with her toys & friends. She loves to play different kind of toys and will never let you down when you get her a new toy - she will play it smartly in front of you. She do not like to be carried or hugged, but sometimes she will be very manja, she will just sit beside you and ask for your love and a pat on head.

When i found her, she was hiding in my shoe rack, so, i made them a place to stay; a box, with an old towel, a bowl of water and some kitten food. It was ok for the first 3 days. On the 4th day i noticed the female cat is away for a longer period than usual. As i was away yesterday, i told my brother to keep a lookout for the female cat and it seems she hasnt returned since last night. They have been crying for quite a while and I think they're just hungry. In the mean time, we're taking care of these kittens, feeding it with milk replacement. Appreciate if some kind soul out there would adopt/foster these kittens, preferably someone with a mother cat who just gave birth and wouldnt mind additional members to the family.

3ee594f5a,0,1,0,0,"Hi everyone! My name is Theo and i'm about 3 weeks old now. My auntie Rebecca rescued me on monday 15 June . She found me behind her house surrounded by dogs!! She quickly picked me up and brought me inside her house. Sadly auntie Rebecca is busy fostering 5 pups and their mum so she called my new foster mummy Lynette for help. When i arrived at mummy Lyn's house she was amazed by how chubby and healthy i looked!! She says i'm so cute that i make her eyes hurt!! I'm not weaned yet so mummy Lyn still has to feed me kitty milk. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Theo. - See if potential adopter and Theo are suitable for each other. I will ask a lot of questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Theo vaccinated before being able to take Theo home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I will make a home visit. - Adopter may have to provide me with occasional updates. Interested parties can call, sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.

They are two little beauties with the smoothest, glossiest fur i have ever touched. These brothers are extremely close and I want them to be ADOPTED TOGETHER. Mr fluffers is the leader of the two as he is more daring, outgoing, and openly affectionate. Cocochino harbors some fear of strangers and it took him a long time to warm up to me. He follows what his brother does all the time. So, when he sees that fluffers and i are having fun together, he loosens up and joins in. He loses his fear when he is together with fluffers, separate them and his fears return. If you are looking for INDOOR cats and don't mind their high energy play, you can call me at . Adopter must be a very patient person as Cocochino will not be immediately friendly, must be willing to put in effort to build a relationship with these boys, a true cat lover. The succesful adopter will have to reimburse me for Mr Fluffers and Cocochino's neutering and vaccinations at which point i will hand over their medical booklets. This means the adopter must pay me back for what i have spent on their neutering and vaccinations. I don't make a profit. They have received their first and second vaccinations.

They were rescued by Ariyanti Zainol (Mimi) from Bukit Beruntung when their mother died attacked by a dog.

We believe she was attacked by another cat in the area, we couldn't just leave her outside. She has a minor cut on her right side, near her armpit. We got her checked at the clinic and doctor said there's nothing to be worried about. Just need to clean the wound daily with water and apply non-steroid antibiotic cream daily. At the moment, we'd like to make sure she healed and healthy before we hand her to a loving adopter :) Sunday is a gentle, manja kitten who loves to be cuddled. She is self-potty-trained and already knows how to use her litter tray! She is allowed to roam freely in our house. There are a few terms and conditions for adopting Sunday: 1) She must be kept INDOORS only. 2) She must not be allowed to roam freely outdoor. 3) She must not be caged for long period of time. 4) She must be provided with all necessities; food, water, shelter, and attention daily. 5) She must be played with daily. 6) She must be spayed/neutered when she's at the right age.

LOVES to play & run about (needs toys, kitty companions or some kind of constant stimulation). Active households are his perfect cup of tea! Maksim is extremely vocal and knows how to talk (meow) back when spoken to. :) ♥ Maksim LOVES being carried over his people's shoulders (he stays put like a parrot and simply enjoys the view he gets). Maksim will also run right over to your lap whenever he's spooked by something (still doesn't stop him from exploring every nook and cranny he can find!) ♥ This boy can be a little demanding when he taps into his manja-moods (asking for cheek-rubs and strokes while he snoozes off). Mind you he has a VERY loud purr! ♥ Maksim is healthy, has been de-wormed (once) and given Frontline (flea medication). Already clever with the litter-box and able to eat kibbles independently. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** - Whenever alone, Maksim tries to ""play"" with our fingers during stroking, and sometimes nips. This is only play-biting and a simple ""shh!"" makes him stop immediately. :) He is a very smart kitten and for this reason, experienced cat owners are preferred. - Maksim must be kept INDOORS at all times and NEUTERED at the right age (adopters who already practice neutering their cats preferred). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc).
